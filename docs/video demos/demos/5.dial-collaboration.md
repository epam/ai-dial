# Collaboration

https://youtu.be/ywmzhAuFMaI

There are three distinct features in DIAL related to collaboration within your organization: [Share](../../user-guide#share), [Export](../../user-guide#export) and [Publish](../../tutorials/Collaboration/enable-publications). Each has its pros and cons, and this video highlights the main similarities and differences within the three. Export creates files that allows you to create moment-in-time snapshots of conversations to share across environments. Share creates a reference to an existing conversation that you can send to colleagues that will update as you continue the conversation. Publications allow you to create a prompt or conversation library that is automatically shared with colleagues along the organization structure.
