# DIAL RAG

Dial RAG is our implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation. The Dial RAG answers user questions using information from the documents provided by user. It supports the following document formats: PDF, DOC/DOCX, PPT/PPTX, TXT and other plain text formats such as code files. Internally, Dial RAG uses the unstructured library to parse the documents. It then employs a combination of semantic search using the bge-small-en embeddings model and a keyword search using the Okapi BM25 ranking algorithm to retrieve relevant parts of the document and pass them to the GPT-4 model to synthesize the answer. Initial processing of a new document may take a significant amount of time because the Dial RAG needs to parse the document and build the search indexes. The application stores pre-computed document indexes in the Dial File storage and reuses these indexes for future requests.
