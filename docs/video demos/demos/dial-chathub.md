DIAL ChatHub is an example of a flow orchestrator that combines several applications and models into one unified access point. ChatHub can automatically route prompts to one of several agents: text-to-text applications, text-to-image applications, vision-to-text applications, DIAL RAG, or DIAL Web RAG. It is just an example of how you can provide a unified access point to several different applications or models within your ecosystem.
