The Omics AI Assistant is an example of our Talk To Your Data framework being applied to the Life Sciences domain. This application contains 8 distinct agents, such as a mapping agent to map from gene IDs to proteins using the UniProt database, an AlphaFold Visualization agent to predict and visualize protein structures using the AlphaFold algorithm, and an Analytics agent that can analyze custom data about proteins or gene information and answer questions about it.
