This video explores a prototype for an athlete profile generator application built for AI DIAL on top of the Talk-To-Your-Data Agent-Based Application Framework. We generate a profile for Mookie Betts, including the latest news, a biography, a heatmap and recent performance analysis, and incorporate deterministic approaches and Python code generation to solve complex tasks.

The DIAL Oil and Gas AI Assistant application is another example of an agent-based assistant built on DIAL's Talk-To-Your-Data Framework. In this example, we explore Volve Production data, and show some examples of how DIAL applications can generate code to do data visualizations, calculations and interpretations of this data.
