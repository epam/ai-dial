# GCP Deployment

This video contains step-by-step instructions to deploy DIAL from [Google Cloud Marketplace (GCP)](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/epam-mp-dial/epam-ai-dial). The listing automatically creates the service accounts with necessary roles, and launches the VM for you with a pre-configured instance of DIAL leveraging the models available in Vertex AI (PaLM, Gemini, Imagen, and Gemini Vision). It is intended as a "test" installation for educational purposes, and lacks many of the enterprise features available from the main GitHub repository.

> * Refer to [DIAL Helm](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/main/charts/dial/examples/gcp/complete/README.md) repository to GCP installation documentation.
