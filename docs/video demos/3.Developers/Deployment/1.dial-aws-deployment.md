https://youtu.be/vE6mLwR6IGM

This video contains step-by-step instructions to deploy DIAL from [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-zx4u372lqvtfi). It is intended as a "test" installation for educational purposes, and lacks many of the enterprise features available from the main GitHub repository.

> - Refer to [DIAL Helm](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/main/charts/dial/examples/aws/complete/README.md) repository to AWS installation documentation.
> - Refer to [tutorials](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/0.deployment/5.aws-deployment-guide.md) for deployment guidelines.
