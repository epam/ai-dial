# DIAL RAG Evaluation Toolkit

The RAG evaluation toolkit consists of three distinct tools: our DIAL Log Parser,  our RAG evaluation library, and our RAG evaluation UI. The parser converts DIAL logs into usable .parquet files containing all relevant information about prompts, responses, and user feedback. The evaluation library allows you to compare responses and retrieval algorithms with the expected ground truth facts. The UI allows you to visualize and analyze this data. It is used to validate the quality of the retrieval of any RAG-based application.
