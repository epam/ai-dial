# DIAL GCP Deployment

https://youtu.be/PV02IUqLo1c

This video contains step-by-step instructions to deploy DIAL from [Google Cloud Marketplace (GCP)](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/epam-mp-dial/epam-ai-dial). The listing automatically creates the service accounts with necessary roles, and launches the VM for you with a pre-configured instance of DIAL leveraging the models available in Vertex AI (PaLM, Gemini, Imagen, and Gemini Vision). It is intended as a "test" installation for educational purposes, and lacks many of the enterprise features available from the main GitHub repository.
