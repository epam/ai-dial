In this tutorial, we will be deploying AI DIAL from GitHub and launching it with AI DIAL Chat and vision models from Ollama. We will take a look at the DIAL Configuration files and outline how to connect models and applications to AI DIAL. In the [part 2](/docs/video%20demos/demos-for-developers/5.develop-application.md), we will be developing a simple text translator application.
