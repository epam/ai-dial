Publications allow users to publish and share resources such as conversations, prompts, files, or applications within their organization. These resources can be made accessible to specific individuals or teams by managing access rights. The publication process involves sending a publication request, which is then reviewed and either approved or declined by an administrator. Once approved, the published resources become available to the target audience. Resource owners also have the ability to unpublish resources if needed. Publications also support detailed version history, allowing users to update existing publications without overwriting them.
