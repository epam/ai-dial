If you want to make your own chats or stories with custom variables and share them with your team, you can use a feature called **Parameterized Replay**. Use it to set up a chat or a story that others can follow, but provide their own details or answers to create a personalized experience. This makes chat a much more useful tool for sharing information and collaboration. 

Furthermore, you can use Replay with any [models](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md), assistants, or applications supported in DIAL, which means you can utilize this in complex Talk-To-Your-Data Workflows as well. 

When combined with DIAL's collaborative tools like [Publications](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/1.configuration/1.enable-publications-chat.md), you can use Parameterized Replay to increase efficiency with just about any business flows!
