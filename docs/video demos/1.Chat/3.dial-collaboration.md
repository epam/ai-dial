# Collaboration

https://youtu.be/ywmzhAuFMaI

There are three distinct features in DIAL related to collaboration within your organization: [Share](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#share), [Export](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#export) and [Publish](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/1.configuration/1.enable-publications-chat.md). Each has its pros and cons, and this video highlights the main similarities and differences within the three.

> Refer to [Collaboration](/docs/platform/7.collaboration-intro.md) to learn more.

- Export creates files that allows you to create moment-in-time snapshots of conversations/prompts to share across environments.
- Share creates a reference to an existing conversation/prompt/app that you can send to colleagues that will update as you continue the conversation.
- Publications allow you to create a prompt or conversation library that is automatically shared with colleagues along the organization structure.
