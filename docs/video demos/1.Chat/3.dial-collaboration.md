# Collaboration

https://youtu.be/ywmzhAuFMaI

There are three distinct features in DIAL related to collaboration within your organization: [Share](/docs/user-guide.md#share), [Export](/docs/user-guide.md#export) and [Publish](/docs/tutorials/collaboration/2.enable-publications.md). Each has its pros and cons, and this video highlights the main similarities and differences within the three. Export creates files that allows you to create moment-in-time snapshots of conversations to share across environments. Share creates a reference to an existing conversation that you can send to colleagues that will update as you continue the conversation. Publications allow you to create a prompt or conversation library that is automatically shared with colleagues along the organization structure.
