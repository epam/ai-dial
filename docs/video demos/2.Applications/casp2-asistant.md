# Caspase-2 Article Visualization

https://youtu.be/SylMQwIBpGA

This case study demonstrates how you can use DIAL to make your life as a researcher easier by turning complex scientific articles (even a combination of them) into intuitive and user-friendly knowledge graphs.

In this example, we used DIAL Mindmap to transform the Nature Cell Biology article ["Caspase-2 is a condensate-mediated deubiquitinase in protein quality control"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-024-01522-8) into a visual knowledge graph.

It breaks down the provided data into logical and hierarchical structure, connects key concepts and ideas, provides summaries and useful information with links to the original sources.

Key benefits:

* Scientists can quickly navigate the ever-growing universe of scientific articles using knowledge graphs enriched with logical connections, summaries and references to sources.
* Researchers can quickly grasp complicated topics (in our case it is the protein quality control and its connection to diseases such as neurodegeneration).
* Presenting information in a simplified visual format accelerates the process of identifying key insights and actionable solutions (in our case it is potential targets for treating cellular health disorders).
