# CASPASE2 Article Visualization

https://youtu.be/SylMQwIBpGA

This case study demonstrates how apps created in DIAL can turn complex scientific articles into simple, easy-to-navigate knowledge graphs.
Using the Nature Cell Biology article "Caspase-2 is a condensate-mediated deubiquitinase in protein quality control" as an example, we used the application type called Mindmap to build an app that transforms the article’s data into a visual knowledge graph.

It breaks down the provided data into logical and hierarchical structure, connects key concepts and ideas, provides summaries and useful information with links to the original sources.

Key benefits:
* Scientists can quickly navigate the ever-growing universe of scientific articles using knowledge graphs enriched with logical connections, summaries and references to sources.
* Researchers can quickly grasp complicated topics (in our case it is the protein quality control and its connection to diseases such as neurodegeneration). 
* Presenting information in a simplified visual format accelerates the process of identifying key insights and actionable solutions (in our case it is potential targets for treating cellular health disorders).*
