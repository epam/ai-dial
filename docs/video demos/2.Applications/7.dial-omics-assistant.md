In this case study we demonstrate how you can use DIAL to create [multi-agent](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md) applications to work with scientific data on the example of OMICS dataset.

We created Omics AI Assistant that includes several agents handling tasks such as data query, visualization and analysis.

Key highlights:

* [Conversational Interface](/docs/platform/4.chat/0.about-chat.md): Researchers interact with the system through the DIAL Chat interface powered by language models, enabling intuitive information retrieval and analysis.
* [Versatile Knowledge Representation](/docs/platform/4.chat/2.data-visualization-intro.md): Discovered knowledge is presented in various formats like dynamic charts, tables, markdown, and visualizations, serving diverse analytical needs.
* [Knowledge Sharing](/docs/platform/7.collaboration-intro.md): The DIAL platform facilitates collaboration by enabling easy sharing of knowledge representations, effectively bridging knowledge gaps in an organization.

You can use DIAL platform to create [multi-agent](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md) applications such as Omics AI Assistant help conduct open-ended analysis and exploration of data to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies that can lead to new insights and hypotheses.
