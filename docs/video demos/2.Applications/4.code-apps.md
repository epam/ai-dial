DIAL allows you to develop, deploy and run your Python applications directly in the DIAL UI. In this video, we will demonstrate how to:

* Create and customize your own Code App 
* Use the built-in Python code editor 
* Deploy applications without worrying about hosting or scalability 
* Implement essential endpoints for DIAL compatibility 
* Manage environment variables 
* Deploy, edit, and publish your apps

We'll walk through creating a Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application, demonstrating the flexibility and ease of use that Code Apps offer. Whether you're a developer looking to streamline your workflow or an organization aiming to build a collaborative AI ecosystem, this video showcases how DIAL's Code Apps can revolutionize your approach to GenAI exploration.
