# DIAL Entity Extractor

DIAL Entity Extractor helps create applications to accurately identify and retrieve predefined sets of information from unstructured sources. For example extract drug names and side effects from clinical research studies, or financial metrics from annual reports of companies.

The application allows you to define sets of attributes you are looking for, upload documents in different formats, manually validate the extraction results and generate reports based on the findings.

In this video, we demonstrate how we used Entity Extractor to create a claims processing assistant for a large multi-national insurance company.
