This case study demonstrates how DIAL can be used to create powerful multi-agent and multi-modal applications.

In this example, we are using the Athlete Profile Generator app, which includes several specialized agents working together to create a detailed profile of Mookie Betts, a professional baseball player.

The end-user just enters the playerâ€™s name and enjoys a seamless experience with all the complex processes handled behind the scenes.

Under the hood, dedicated agents perform specific tasks at each step. To ensure accuracy and transparency, the app provides calculations, source code, and links to resources for validation of the results.

The DIAL Oil and Gas AI Assistant application is another example of an agent-based assistant built on DIAL's Talk-To-Your-Data Framework. In this example, we explore Volve Production data, and show some examples of how DIAL applications can generate code to do data visualizations, calculations and interpretations of this data.
