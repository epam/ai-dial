DIAL Web RAG combines Cloud Search APIs with DIAL RAG to allow users to search the web and their own documents. This application illustrates the [agentic approach](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md) in DIAL, where applications can use agents as building blocks to perform specific tasks - in this case DIAL Web RAG uses DIAL RAG. Web RAG retrieves the most relevant results from Cloud Search APIs and runs them through DIAL RAG to pass the LLM additional context for summarization.
