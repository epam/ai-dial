DIAL RAG is our implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). 

DIAL RAG answers user questions using information from the documents provided by user. It supports the following document formats: PDF, DOC/DOCX, PPT/PPTX, TXT and other plain text formats such as code files. Internally, DIAL RAG uses the unstructured library to parse the documents. It then employs a combination of semantic search using the bge-small-en embeddings model and a keyword search using the Okapi BM25 ranking algorithm to retrieve relevant parts of the document and pass them to the GPT-4 model to synthesize the answer. Initial processing of a new document may take a significant amount of time because the DIAL RAG needs to parse the document and build the search indexes. The application stores pre-computed document indexes in the DIAL File storage and reuses these indexes for future requests.
