DIAL ChatHub is an example of a multi-agent orchestrator that combines applications and models as agents into one unified access point. ChatHub can automatically route prompts to one of several agents to perform a specific task: text-to-text applications, text-to-image applications, vision-to-text applications, Python Code Interpreter, [DIAL RAG](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/1.dial-rag.md), or [Web RAG](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/2.dial-web-rag.md).
