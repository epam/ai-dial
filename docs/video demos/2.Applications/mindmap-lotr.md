This case study showcases how DIAL enables the creation of interactive visualizations for complex, multilayered information with just a few clicks.

For this example, we created an AI-powered application, that visualizes Lord of the Rings (LOTR) cinematic universe.

Key highlights:

* Map Generation: The app extracts data from LOTR fan wikis, logically organizes it, connects related elements, generates summaries, links to original sources, and renders it as an interactive visual map.
* Enhanced Visuals: AI-generated images enrich map elements for a more immersive experience.
* Intuitive Exploration: Users can explore the LOTR universe through natural language queries in chat and seamless map navigation.
* Reliable Answers: The app cites sources for all answers and allows manual customization of map elements to ensure accuracy and reliability.
