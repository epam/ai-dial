# Overview

Observability is the ability to infer a system's internal state from its external outputs.
AI DIAL supports Prometheus and OpenTelemetry (OTEL) methods enhance observability by providing powerful metrics collection and tracing capabilities, enabling deeper insights into system performance and behavior.

For DIAL application we have few options to monitoring/observability:
- Prometheus (pull/scrape model)
- OTLP (push model)
- Both (application can be configured to use both approaches)
