# OpenTelemetry method
## Introduction
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is an open-source observability framework designed to standardize the collection of telemetry data across distributed systems. By providing a unified set of APIs, libraries, and agents, it enables developers to capture traces, metrics, and logs from their applications seamlessly. OpenTelemetry simplifies the monitoring process and enhances visibility into application performance and reliability, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and optimize systems in real-time.
## Configuration

Environment Variables for the Configuration of Opentelemetry
All standard env variables you could find in the official opentelemetry [documentation](https://opentelemetry-python-contrib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instrumentation/logging/logging.html). If no value set for the OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER then OpenTelemetry Prometheus Metric Exporter will be used. If value set to "otlp" the OpenTelemetry Collector Metrics Exporter for web and node will be used.
```json
OTEL_PYTHON_LOG_CORRELATION: "true|false"
OTEL_PYTHON_FASTAPI_EXCLUDED_URLS: "<exclude_url>"
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER: "otlp"
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER: "otlp|otlp,prometheus"
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER: "otlp"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "<otlp_endpoint_url>"
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES: "service.name=<service_name>"
```

Where:
- `OTEL_PYTHON_LOG_CORRELATION` - enable trace context injection
- `OTEL_PYTHON_FASTAPI_EXCLUDED_URLS`: to exclude certain URLs from tracking
- `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` - Logs exporter to be used
- `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` - Metrics exporter to be used
- `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` - Trace exporter to be used
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` - OTEL endpoint URL
- `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` - Key-value pairs to be used as resource attributes

The DIAL ecosystem includes other programming languages (for example chat use nodejs )
