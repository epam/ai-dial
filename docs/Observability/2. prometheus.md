# Prometheus method
## Introduction
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects metrics from configured targets at specified intervals, stores them in a time-series database, and provides powerful querying capabilities. With its flexible architecture, Prometheus is particularly suited for dynamic environments, making it a popular choice for cloud-native applications and microservices. Its intuitive visualization tools help teams gain deep insights into system performance, ensuring timely detection of issues.
