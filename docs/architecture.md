# Our Vision 

AI DIAL is a secure, enterprise-grade and open-source platform. It has an API-first, cloud and model-agnostic design that makes it suitable for a wide variety of use cases. 
Our primary focus is to avoid reliance on particular cloud or LLM vendors, support scalability and security, avoid increasing tech complexity or licensing risks. 
We prioritize developing use case-agnostic generic features that facilitate developing of GenAI applications.
