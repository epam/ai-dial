# Chat User Guide

## Interface Components

The AI DIAL Chat application interface has several sections, such as the chat box, settings, and panels for managing conversations and saved prompts.

![](./img/home.png)

1. [Conversations](#conversations): Here, you can manage your conversations: create new ones, organize them in folders, and delete. You can collapse and expand the panel by clicking the **Hide panel** icon above it.
2. **Chat**: Use this section to enter a prompt, view results, and interact with language models.
3. [Chat Settings](#chat-settings): In this section, you can select the language model, assistant, application, and addons you'd like to use. You can also provide a system prompt and adjust the temperature setting.
4. [Prompts](#prompts): In this section, you can work with saved prompts: create new templates, update them, and organize them in folders. You can collapse and expand the panel by clicking the **Hide panel** icon above it.
5. [User Settings](#user-settings): In your user settings, you can customize the color theme (dark or light), choose a custom logo and other customization options.

## Conversations

In the AI DIAL framework, a conversation is a dialogue between an agent, such as a language model, assistant, or application, and a human user. The agent uses natural language to interact with a human and receive/give a feedback. Within one conversation, you can refer to previous questions and answers. But different conversations donâ€™t share context.

> All your conversations are stored on the server, and you can access them from any device you use.

 
### Actions

**During a conversation**, you can perform various actions:

- **Enter prompt**: you can use a text box at the bottom to enter your prompts. 
- **Generate answer**: click enter to generate the response to your prompt. 
- **Stop generating**: in the process of generating the response, you can stop it.
- **Regenerate response**: when stopped, you can regenerate the response. **Important**: If you encounter a server error or click the **Stop Generating** button and receive an empty response, the **Send** button will be disabled. To continue the conversation, you'll need to generate the answer again. If you receive a partial response (a combination of text and an error), the model can still proceed, while for Assistants/Applications, you'll need to generate the response again.
- **Delete/Edit**: during the conversation, you can edit or delete your prompts. After a prompt has been edited, the response is regenerated, and all your prompts after the edited one will be deleted. When you delete your prompt, the response will be deleted, too.
- **Attach files**: some models and applications (e.g. _DIAL RAG_) support adding attachments (files, links, folders) to conversations. In this case, you'll see the **Attachments** icon available in the chat box. Click it to upload a file from your device or select an already uploaded file. Refer to the [Manage attachments](#attachments) section for details.
- **Download attached files**: click the **Download** icon near the file name.
- **Preview attached images**: click the **Expand** icon near the image name. 
- **Copy**: you can copy answers.
- **Like/dislike**: you can like and dislike responses in a conversation. Use likes to highlight important responses and dislikes to mark the responses you don't need. 
- **Clear conversation messages**: you can clear all messages in your conversation. Click the eraser icon on the top bar to do that. 
- **Change conversation settings**: during the conversation, you can access and edit its setting by clicking the gear icon on the top bar. Refer to [Chat Settings](#conversation-settings) to learn more.
- **View current settings**: on the top bar, point to the language model logo icon near the conversation name to see current settings.

### Arrange

You can gather your conversations in folders.

![](./img/move_conv.png)

You can create a hierarchy of folders with three nesting levels. Just create a folder and drag-n-drop it in the other folder to create a nesting level. The same way, you can either drag-n-drop a conversation into a folder or use **Move to** in the context menu of a conversation to move it to a folder.
Empty folders are deleted after refreshing a page.

The following symbols in the folders names are prohibited: tab, ":", ";", "/", "\", ",", "=", "{", "}", "%", "&" and will be excluded. Note that you can use the "." symbol at the start or inside a name, but the dot at the end will be automatically removed.

The MAX length of the folder name is limited to 160 symbols. Everything beyond is cut off. 

> When you use the contextual menu to move a conversation, you can create a new folder, in which the conversation should be moved.

### Search and Filter

The **Search** box can be utilized to find conversations and folders by their names.

![](./img/export_all.png)

### Import

Exported conversations can be imported. 

To import JSON or a zip file with conversations, click the **Import conversations** icon at the bottom of the left panel and then select a file with conversations.

> When you import a conversation with attachments, the attachments will be available in the Imports folder.
 
![](./img/import_conv.png)

> Note, that when importing a duplicate of an existing conversation, you will be prompted to select one of the proceeding options: replace, ignore or add a prefix to the imported conversation. If the imported conversation includes attachments, you will be prompted to make the same selection for them as well.

![](./img/import-export.png)

### Delete

You can delete a single conversation or all conversations.

To delete a single conversation, on the left panel, in the conversation contextual menu, select **Delete** and confirm your action.

![](./img/Delete_conv.png)

To delete all conversations, at the bottom of the left panel, click the **Delete conversations** icon.
 
### Replay

You can use **Replay** to reproduce conversations but with different settings (e.g. a different model). A replayed conversation can be used to compare responses to the same questions from different models and with different settings of the conversation. 

![](./img/replay2.png)
 
Use **Replay as is** to reproduce the conversation with the original settings. 

![](./img/Replay_as_is.png) 

To replay a conversation: 

1.	Click **Replay** in the conversation menu. 
2.	Select **Replay as is** in **More info** in the Replay settings to reproduce the conversation with the original settings or change the conversation settings. 
3.	Click **Start replay**.
4.	In the process of replaying, you can stop and resume the replay process.

The replayed conversation is displayed as a new conversation with the `[Replay]` tag in the list of your conversations. 

### Playback

The Playback mode can be used to simulate the current conversation without any engagement with models. This mode accurately reproduces the conversation like a recording. It should be noted that this differs from the Replay mode, where the prompts are resubmitted to the chosen model and the outcomes may differ from the initial conversation.

![](./img/playback2.png)

During the playback, you can move back and forward the playback process or stop it.

### Compare

Use the Compare mode to compare two new (or two existing) conversations with different setting (e.g. different models or temperature).

![](./img/compare2.png)

**To compare two **new** conversations**:

1.	Click the **Compare** icon at the bottom of the left panel.
2.	Choose settings of the first conversations.
3.	Choose settings of the second conversation.
4.	Type your question (prompt) in the chat box.

As you can see on the picture above, the system creates two conversations with the same name but adds numbers to them. If you have chosen different language models, the conversations icons on the left panel will differ.
 
**You can also compare two existing conversations**:

![](./img/compare.png)

> The Compare mode works only with conversations with the same amount of prompts from a user. The application will not allow comparing two conversations with different amounts of prompts.

1.	On the left panel, in the conversation menu of a conversation, select **Compare**.
2.	In the main section, under **Select conversation to compare with**, select the second conversation from the drop box. 
3. By default, only conversations with the same name are available in the drop box. Select **Show all conversations** to see the full list of conversations.
4.	Type your question (prompt) in the chat box.

### Attachments

AI DIAL applications (e.g. DIAL RAG) can support attaching files, links or folders to a conversation and generate responses considering the attached resources.

![](./img/attachment1.png)

#### Folders

If the selected application supports this, you can click the attachment icon in the conversation box and select **Attach folders**.

> Note, that you can attach only folders from the file manager and cannot upload folders from an external source.

1. In the Manage attachments dialog, point to a file and select it. You can select several files.
2. Click the **Delete** icon below the files tree.

## Prompts

A prompt is an instruction, a question, or a message that a user provides to a language model to receive an answer. Prompts can also contain constraints or requirements. They help the model understand the task at hand and the types of responses that are expected. 
You can use prompts as templates for your messages, instructions to the model, or to encourage the model to generate specific types of content. 
In AI DIAL, you can create prompts beforehand and reuse them in one or several conversations.

Prompts can be applied to one message or a whole conversation. Refer to the [System prompt](#system-prompt) section of this guide for details.

The section with your prompts is located in the right-hand area of the screen. In this section, you can work with saved prompts: create new templates, update them, and organize them with folders. 

> All your prompts are stored on the server, and you can access them from any device you use.

### Actions

![](./img/prompt_actions.png)

You can perform various actions with your prompts:

- **Edit**: select a prompt on the right panel to invoke the Edit window. Make all necessary changes and click **Save**. 
- **Export**: right-click a prompt on the right panel and select **Export**. The prompt will be exported as JSON.
- **Import**: click the **Import prompts** icon at the bottom of the right panel and then select a JSON file with prompts.
- **Move to**: use to place a prompt in a folder.

- **Unshare**: use to revoke access to shared prompts.

### Arrange

You can gather your prompts in folders.

![](./img/move_prompt.png)
 
You can create a hierarchy of folders with three nesting levels. Just create a folder and drag-n-drop it in the other folder to create a nesting level. 
The same way, you can either drag-n-drop a prompt into a folder or use **Move to** in the context menu of a prompt to place it in one of the folders.  

> After refreshing the page or logging in again, any empty folders will be deleted.

The following symbols in the folders names are prohibited: tab, ":", ";", "/", "\", ",", "=", "{", "}", "%", "&". Note that you can use the "." symbol at the start or inside a name, but the dot at the end will be automatically removed. The MAX length of the folder name is limited to 160 symbols. Everything beyond is cut off. 

### Search and Filter

![](./img/pt_search.png)

The **Search** box can be utilized to find prompts and folders by their names.

You can filter prompts by the "Shared by me" criterion. To do so, click the **Filter** icon and select **Shared by me**.
 
### Create

![](./img/create-pt.png)

To create a new prompt:

1.	On the right panel, select **New prompt**.
2.	Fill in the **Name**, **Description**, and **Prompt** boxes. The following symbols in the prompt names are prohibited: tab, ":", ";", "/", "\", ",", "=", "{", "}", "%", "&". Note that you can use the "." symbol at the start or inside a name, but the dot at the end will be automatically removed. The MAX length of the prompt name is limited to 160 symbols. Everything beyond is cut off.

  > Please note that both the **Name** and **Description** fields are mandatory to fill in order to create a prompt!

3.	Click **Save**.

>  **Name** and **Description** arenâ€™t used as instructions for a language model. They only help you to distinguish the prompt from others. The language model will only use instructions from the **Prompt** box.

#### Variables

You can use prompts as templates for your messages to a language model. For example, you need to calculate an equation `a + c/d`, round up the answer, and then divide it by 4. Letâ€™s imagine that you need results for four sets of `a`, `c`, and `d`.
 
In that case you can create the following prompt:

![](./img/Prompt_example_math_edit_window.png)

 
Here, `a`, `c`, and `d` are variables. In the prompt body, they are denoted by double curly brackets: `{{ }}`.

> You can combine mathematical expressions and natural language in your prompts.

After youâ€™ve created the prompt, you can use it by typing a slash `/` in the chat box and selecting the name of a prompt (it is **Math** in our example). Youâ€™ll see the following form where you can enter any numbers:

![](./img/Prompt_example_math_enter_variables.png)

When you submit the form, your message will look like on the illustration below:
  
![](./img/Prompt_example_math_resulting_message.png)

Send the message to the model, and it will generate an answer using both mathematical and natural language instructions:
 
![](./img/Prompt_example_math_response.png)

Generally, variables can be anything, not only numbers. For example, you can create a prompt with the following body: `Who played {{character}} in {{movie}}? or What is a Latin name of {{plant common name}}?`

### Share

You can share a prompt or a folder with several prompts with other users.

**To Receive a Shared Prompt**:

To obtain a prompt from someone else (receive a shared prompt), you must get a link from them. By clicking on this link, you will import the prompt into your chat.

When someone shares a prompt with you, you can find it in the **Shared with me** section on the right panel. **Important**: you cannot change a prompt that has been shared with you. To be able to work with it, [duplicate it](#duplicate-1). When you receive a shared prompt, a pop-up window opens up, where you can preview a prompt and duplicate it if needed.

You can always view prompts that have been shared with you in a dedicated section and perform various actions on them such as 

![](./img/shared_prompt2.png)

* View: opens a pop-up window with a prompt preview.
* Duplicate: use to duplicate a shared with you prompt to be able to modify it. 
* Delete: remove from the list.
* Export: download in a JSON format.


**To Share a Prompt**:

To share a prompt or a folder, click **Share** in the contextual menu and copy the link. After someone has opened your link, an arrow icon appears near its name and this prompt can be found when **Shared by me** checkbox is selected in the **Search** menu.

Titan is designed to handle complex natural language processing tasks, such as summarization, dialogue generation, and translation.

### Assistants

1. In the **Talk to** area, click **See full list...** to display all the available models, applications and assistants.
2. All tabs (Models, Applications and Assistants) are enabled by default. To display just Assistants, disable the rest and keep the **Assistants** tab active.
3. Click any of the available assistants to start a conversation. 

![](./img/Talk_to_full_list_assistants.png)

In the AI DIAL framework, Assistants are a combination of preselected Addons and System Prompts that enable specific behavior in the LLM, allowing for more tailored and adaptive responses to user needs. Unlike the Model+Addon configuration, where users have the flexibility to choose different Addons, Assistants come with predetermined Addons that cannot be removed or unselected. However, the Model can still be reassigned within the Assistant.

Assistants give you more control over LLM behavior, resulting in tailored and accurate responses that match specific needs. The flexibility of this combination lets you create custom Assistants within the AI DIAL framework. These Assistants can range from simple tasks, like asking the LLM to provide answers in a specific tone or style (e.g., like a pirate), to more complex tasks, such as restricting the LLM's data to a specific geographical area (e.g., providing weather forecasts for Chicago only). Combining Addons and System Prompts enables better customization and adaptability to various situations, leading to more versatile responses.

In a chat application, you can include custom Assistant(s) that users can choose when using AI DIAL.

### Applications

1. In the **Talk to** area, click **See full list...** to display all the available models, applications and assistants.
2. All tabs (Models, Applications and Assistants) are enabled by default. To display just Applications, disable the rest and keep the **Applications** tab active.
3. Click any of the available applications to start a conversation. 

![](./img/applications.png)

In the AI DIAL framework, Applications are ready-to-use solutions made up of predefined configurations of Addons and other services or any custom logic. They help you customize LLM behavior by integrating Addons with any desired logic. Applications can be any component that meets API requirements and implements non-LLM-related logic, such as repeating user messages, creating a fully deterministic chatbot, or managing complex multi-LLM interactions. This versatility in Applications allows for tailored handling of unique scenarios and requirements.

### System Prompt

![](./img/system_prompt.png)

The system prompt in AI DIAL refers to the initial instructions given to the model. You can use any previously created prompt as a system prompt (for details, refer to the [Create](#create) in Prompts), and it will set the context and tone for the whole conversation.

The system prompt in AI DIAL is like a compass for a traveler, pointing the model in the right direction to navigate the conversational landscape, ensuring it stays on course and aligned with the overall purpose and desired outcome. 

You can change system prompts during a conversation by selecting the **Settings** icon at the top bar of the conversation. 

#### Example

Letâ€™s compare a conversation with a system prompt selected and a conversation without a system prompt. For illustration purposes, weâ€™re going to use the compare mode (refer to the [Compare](#compare) section for details) and create two conversations with identical settings except for the system prompt selection.

The prompt used as a system prompt is as follows:

> Let's play a game. Name a city that starts with the last letter of the one that I named in a previous message and then tell me that it is my turn to name a city.

![](./img/System_prompt_example_compare_settings.png)

![](./img/System_prompt_example_conversation.png)

| **User message** | **Language model response without a system prompt** | **Language model response with a system prompt** |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |

### Temperature

The temperature parameter controls the creativity and randomness of the model's output. A higher temperature (e.g., 1.0) makes the output more diverse and creative, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.1) makes the output more focused and deterministic.

Adjusting the temperature allows you to balance creativity and consistency in the generated response.
 
### Addons

You may want LLM to access particular data or technology to generate responses. This could be your company's database, a collection of PDF documents, calculation engines, API or any other data source or technology.
Within the AI DIAL framework, an Addon is a service or any component that follows the Open API specification. Some examples of Addon implementation are semantic search, Q&A search, DB query generator, or any other custom logic that meets your business needs. AI DIAL can include custom Addons that you can choose to activate a specific system behavior.

1. In the **Talk to** area, click **See all addons...** to display all the available addons.
2. Select one or several addons and click **Apply addons**.

### Isolated View Mode

In the Isolated View Mode, a user can follow a specific URL `https://server/models/modelID` or `https://server/models/applicationID` to use the AI DIAL Chat in a simplified view with minimal configuration settings for a selected model or application. Conversation settings, conversation and prompt panels are not shown in this case. All created conversations are saved and displayed in the regular chat view mode as well (when just created, names of such conversations are appended in the regular view mode with an `isolated` prefix in the beginning. e.g. `isolated_dial-rag`).

For instance, if a user wants to open GPT-4 without any extra features or configurations, they can simply go to `https://AI DIAL Chat URL/models/gpt-4` and access a streamlined user interface that only contains a chat input with GPT-4:

## User Settings

On the top bar, in the user area, you can click a down arrow to access additional settings or logout.

You can select the chat theme, dark or light, add a custom logo, and switch on a full width chat mode.

## Data Visualization

AI DIAL Chat enables data visualization for specific data types using data visualizers. It comes with built-in support for the [Plotly data visualizer](#plotly). To link any other custom visualizers, you can use the [DIAL Chat Visualizer Connector](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-chat/blob/development/libs/chat-visualizer-connector/README.md) library.

### Plotly

Plotly is an open-source JavaScript library that enables the creation of diverse data visualizations, including charts, 3D graphs, and more.

> Refer to [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) to learn more. 

AI DIAL Chat integrates with Plotly, offering robust data visualization capabilities. To utilize Plotly, choose an AI DIAL application that supports this feature. These applications must be capable of querying data (either from a URL or directly from the Chat application) based on user input and returning it in a format compatible with Plotly. Chat automatically detects attachments in this format and uses Plotly to visualize the data.

The visualizations come with standard Plotly controls for easy manipulation.

### Tables

AI DIAL Chat supports rendering of tables and copying table data in various formats out-of-the-box.
