Titan is designed to handle complex natural language processing tasks, such as summarization, dialogue generation, and translation.

#### Assistants

![](./img/Talk_to_full_list_assistants.png)

In the AI DIAL framework, Assistants are a combination of preselected Addons and System Prompts that enable specific behavior in the LLM, allowing for more tailored and adaptive responses to user needs. Unlike the Model+Addon configuration, where users have the flexibility to choose different Addons, Assistants come with predetermined Addons that cannot be removed or unselected. However, the Model can still be reassigned within the Assistant.

Assistants give you more control over LLM behavior, resulting in tailored and accurate responses that match specific needs. The flexibility of this combination lets you create custom Assistants within the AI DIAL framework. These Assistants can range from simple tasks, like asking the LLM to provide answers in a specific tone or style (e.g., like a pirate), to more complex tasks, such as restricting the LLM's data to a specific geographical area (e.g., providing weather forecasts for Chicago only). Combining Addons and System Prompts enables better customization and adaptability to various situations, leading to more versatile responses.

In a chat application, you can include custom Assistant(s) that users can choose when using AI DIAL.

#### Applications   

![](./img/Talk_to_full_list_apps.png)

In the AI DIAL framework, Applications are ready-to-use solutions made up of predefined configurations of Addons and other services or any custom logic. They help you customize LLM behavior by integrating Addons with any desired logic. Applications can be any component that meets API requirements and implements non-LLM-related logic, such as repeating user messages, creating a fully deterministic chatbot, or managing complex multi-LLM interactions. This versatility in Applications allows for tailored handling of unique scenarios and requirements.

#### System Prompt

![](./img/Settings_System_prompt.png)

The system prompt in AI DIAL refers to the initial instructions given to the model. You can use any previously created prompt as a system prompt (for details, refer to the [Create](#create) in Prompts), and it will set the context and tone for the whole conversation.

The system prompt in AI DIAL is like a compass for a traveler, pointing the model in the right direction to navigate the conversational landscape, ensuring it stays on course and aligned with the overall purpose and desired outcome. 

You can change system prompts during a conversation by selecting the **Settings** icon at the top bar of the conversation. 

#### Example of Prompt

Let’s compare a conversation with a system prompt selected and a conversation without a system prompt. For illustration purposes, we’re going to use the compare mode (refer to the [Compare](#compare) section for details) and create two conversations with identical settings except for the system prompt selection.

The prompt used as a system prompt is as follows:

> Let's play a game. Name a city that starts with the last letter of the one that I named in a previous message and then tell me that it is my turn to name a city.

![](./img/System_prompt_example_compare_settings.png)

![](./img/System_prompt_example_conversation.png)

| **User message** | **Language model response without a system prompt** | **Language model response with a system prompt** |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grodno | Grodno, also known as Hrodna, is a city in western Belarus, near the borders with Poland and Lithuania. It is the administrative center of Grodno region and has a population of around 365,000 people. Grodno is one of the oldest cities in Belarus, dating back to the 11th century. The city boasts a rich history and diverse architectural styles, including baroque, classicism, and modernism. | Oslo. It's your turn!|
| Osaka | Osaka is a large port city and commercial center on the Japanese island of Honshu. It's known for its modern architecture, nightlife, and hearty street food. One of Osaka's most popular tourist destinations is the bustling urban area of Dotonbori, where the city's entertainment and dining scenes come to life with numerous restaurants, bars, and shops. | Ankara. Now it's your turn to name a city! |
| Antwerp | Antwerp is a city in Belgium, and it's the country’s biggest port. It is located on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the Westerschelde estuary. Known for its many historical buildings, squares, museums, and cultural attractions, it's a popular tourist destination. | Prague. Your turn to name a city! |

#### Temperature

The temperature parameter controls the creativity and randomness of the model's output. A higher temperature (e.g., 1.0) makes the output more diverse and creative, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.1) makes the output more focused and deterministic.

![](./img/Settings_Temperature.png)

Adjusting the temperature allows you to balance creativity and consistency in the generated response.
 
#### Addons

You may want LLM to access particular data or technology to generate responses. This could be your company's database, a collection of PDF documents, calculation engines, API or any other data source or technology.
Within the AI DIAL framework, an Addon is a service or any component that follows the Open API specification. LLMs can access and use any desired data source or technology to create responses.

![](./img/Settings_Addons_section.png)

Some examples of Addon implementation are semantic search, Q&A search, DB query generator, or any other custom logic that meets your business needs. AI DIAL can include custom Addons that you can choose to activate a specific system behavior.

### User Settings

On the top bar, in the user area, you can click a down arrow to access additional settings or logout.

You can select the chat theme, dark or light, add a custom logo, and switch on a full width chat mode.

![](./img/settings.png)

## Prompts

A prompt is an instruction, a question, or a message that a user provides to a language model to receive an answer. Prompts can also contain constraints or requirements. They help the model understand the task at hand and the types of responses that are expected. 
You can use prompts as templates for your messages, instructions to the model, or to encourage the model to generate specific types of content. 
In AI DIAL, you can create prompts beforehand and reuse them in one or several conversations.

Prompts can be applied to one message or a whole conversation. Refer to the [System prompt](#system-prompt) section of this guide for details.

The section with your prompts is located in the right-hand area of the screen. In this section, you can work with saved prompts: create new templates, update them, and organize them with folders. 

> All your prompts are stored on the server, and you can access them from any device you use.

### Create

![](./img/Prompt_create.png)

To create a new prompt:

1.	On the right panel, select **New prompt**.
2.	Fill in the **Name**, **Description**, and **Prompt** boxes. The following symbols in the prompt names are prohibited: ":", ";", "/", ",", "=", "{", "}". Note that you can use the "." symbol at the start or inside a name, but the dot at the end will be automatically removed.
3.	Click **Save**.

>  **Name** and **Description** aren’t used as instructions for a language model. They only help you to distinguish the prompt from others. The language model will only use instructions from the **Prompt** box.

### Variables

You can use prompts as templates for your messages to a language model. For example, you need to calculate an equation `a + c/d`, round up the answer, and then divide it by 4. Let’s imagine that you need results for four sets of `a`, `c`, and `d`.
 
In that case you can create the following prompt:

![](./img/Prompt_example_math_edit_window.png)

 
Here, `a`, `c`, and `d` are variables. In the prompt body, they are denoted by double curly brackets: `{{ }}`.

> You can combine mathematical expressions and natural language in your prompts.

After you’ve created the prompt, you can use it by typing a slash `/` in the chat box and selecting the name of a prompt (it is **Math** in our example). You’ll see the following form where you can enter any numbers:

![](./img/Prompt_example_math_enter_variables.png)

When you submit the form, your message will look like on the illustration below:
  
![](./img/Prompt_example_math_resulting_message.png)

Send the message to the model, and it will generate an answer using both mathematical and natural language instructions:
 
![](./img/Prompt_example_math_response.png)

Generally, variables can be anything, not only numbers. For example, you can create a prompt with the following body: `Who played {{character}} in {{movie}}? or What is a Latin name of {{plant common name}}?`

## Conversations

In the AI DIAL framework, a conversation is a dialogue between an agent, such as a language model, assistant, or application, and a human user. The agent uses natural language to interact with a human and receive/give a feedback. Within one conversation, you can refer to previous questions and answers. But different conversations don’t share context.

> All your conversations are stored on the server, and you can access them from any device you use.

### Create

![](./img/Conversation_start_procedure.png)

To create a conversation:
