# Overview

## Introduction

JSON Web Token (JWT) is used for web authentication to securely transmit information between a client and a server as a JSON object. When a user logs in, the server validates the credentials and returns a signed JWT to the user's browser. This JWT contains a payload of data, including the user's identity and permissions.  AI DIAL, allows for the configuration of various Identity Service Providers (IDPs) to manage user identities.

## Configuration

1. Configure IDP
2. Configure AI DIAL Core and Chat
3. (Optional) Further, you can create roles and permission in AI DIAL for your users. Refer to [Roles](/Roles%20and%20Limits/overview#roles) to learn how to create a role.

> Refer to [Auth0](./IDPs/auth0), [AWS Cognito](./IDPs/cognito), [MS Entra](./IDPs/entraID), [Google OAuth2](./IDPs/google), [Keycloak](./IDPs/keycloak), [Okta](./IDPs/okta) to view how to enable them as an identity and access management solution for AI DIAL users.

## Example

For example purposes, lets configure Microsoft Entra to work with AI DIAL as an identity service provider: 

1. [Configure Microsoft Entra](/Auth/Web/IDPs/entraID#configure-microsoft-entra-id): create application, client secret, and user group.
2. [Configure AI DIAL Chat](/Auth/Web/IDPs/entraID#ai-dial-chat-settings) to work with MS Entra.
3. [Configure AI DIAL Core](/Auth/Web/IDPs/entraID#ai-dial-core-settings) to work with MS Entra.
4. (Optional) [Create and assign roles](/Auth/Web/IDPs/entraID#assignment-of-roles).
