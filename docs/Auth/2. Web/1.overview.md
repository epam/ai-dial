# Overview

## Introduction

JSON Web Token (JWT) is used for web authentication to securely transmit information between a client and a server as a JSON object. When a user logs in, the server validates the credentials and returns a signed JWT to the user's browser. This JWT contains information about the user's identity. AI DIAL, allows to use various Identity Service Providers (IDPs) to manage user identities.

## Configuration

1. Configure your identity service provider (IDP)
2. Configure AI DIAL Core and Chat to work with your IDP
3. (Optional) Further, you can create roles and permission in AI DIAL for your users. Refer to [Chat Users](/Roles%20and%20Access%20Control/chat-users) to learn how to do this.

> Refer to [Auth0](./IDPs/auth0), [AWS Cognito](./IDPs/cognito), [MS Entra](./IDPs/entraID), [Google OAuth2](./IDPs/google), [Keycloak](./IDPs/keycloak), [Okta](./IDPs/okta) to view how to enable them as an identity and access management solution for AI DIAL users.

## Example

For example purposes, lets configure Microsoft Entra to work with AI DIAL as an identity service provider: 

1. [Configure Microsoft Entra](/Auth/Web/IDPs/entraID#configure-microsoft-entra-id): create application, client secret, and user group.
2. [Configure AI DIAL Chat](/Auth/Web/IDPs/entraID#ai-dial-chat-settings) to work with MS Entra.
3. [Configure AI DIAL Core](/Auth/Web/IDPs/entraID#ai-dial-core-settings) to work with MS Entra.
4. (Optional) You can now create and assign roles and limits to manage access control of your users to various system resources such as applications, models, assistants and addons. Refer to [Create and assign roles](/Auth/Web/IDPs/entraID#assignment-of-roles) to learn more. Refer to [Roles & Access Control](/Roles%20and%20Access%20Control/overview) to learn more about roles and how to use them.
