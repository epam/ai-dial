# Programmatic Auth

We use API keys for server-to-server interaction with AI DIAL API. 

To use an API key, it is necessary to create one.

### Step 1: Define API Keys

In the `keys` section in the `aidial.config.json` configuration file, you can add API keys. An API Key should be a secure random key of at least 128 bit size.

> In [settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-settings), you can get familiar with the description of the configuration parameters. Refer to [configuration file](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core/blob/development/sample/aidial.config.json#L181) to view the full example. 

In the following example, `"myApiKey"` API key is created for a project `"MyProject"` with the `"default"` role:

```json
//Example extract from aidial.config.json
"keys": {
    "myApiKey": {
        "project": "MyProject",
        "role": "default"
    }
}
```

**Important:** API keys must be associated with a project and role; otherwise a key is invalid.

### Step 2: Assign Roles

API keys must be associated with roles. Such roles are used to manage access to system resources and restrict the number of requests that can be sent to them.

> Refer to [Roles](/Roles%20and%20Access%20Control/overview) to learn more how to use roles.

Roles used by API keys must be declared in the `roles` section.

In the previous example, we assigned the `default` role for `myApiKey` API key. On this step, we need to declare the `default` role in the `roles` section to make a valid configuration. 

Optionally, we can configure limits for this role, or leave them empty to apply an unlimited access. In this example, we grant an unlimited access for the `default` role to the `chat-gpt-35-turbo` model. You can refer to [Roles & Access Control](/Roles%20and%20Access%20Control/API%20Keys) to learn how to define access limits for API keys. 

**Note**, that it is mandatory to define at least one role and assign it for an API key, but you can leave `limits` empty (as shown in the previous example) to apply the default value - `unlimited`.

```Json
//Example extract from aidial.config.json
"keys": {
    "myApiKey": {
        "project": "MyProject",
        "role": "default"
    }
},
"roles": {
    "default": { //role name
        "limits": {
            "chat-gpt-35-turbo": //system resource
            {}
        }
    }
}
