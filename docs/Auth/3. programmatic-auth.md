# Programmatic Auth

We use API keys for server-to-server interaction with AI DIAL API. 

To use an API key, it is necessary to create one.

### Step 1: Define API Keys

In the `keys` section in the `aidial.config.json` file, you can add API keys. API Key should be a secure random key of at least 128 bit size.

> **Important:** API keys must be associated with a project and role; otherwise a key is invalid - see [Assign Roles](#assign-roles).

> In [settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-settings), you can get familiar with the description of the configuration parameters. Refer to [configuration file](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core/blob/development/sample/aidial.config.json) to view the full example. 

In the following example, `"proxyKey1"` API key is created for a project `"Project1"` with the `"default"` role:

```json
//Example extract from aidial.config.json
"keys": {
    "proxyKey1": {
        "project": "Project1",
        "role": "default"
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Assign Roles

API keys must be associated with roles. Such roles are used to manage access to system resources and restrict the number of tokens that can be sent to a model. **Note**, that it is mandatory to define at least one role and assign it for an API key, but you can leave `limits` empty to apply the default value - `unlimited`.

> Refer to [Roles](/Roles%20and%20Limits/overview#roles) to learn how to create a role.

In the following example, we assign the `default` role for `projectKey1` API key. This role grants access to the `chat-gpt-35-turbo` model with unlimited number of tokens. 

> Refer to [configuration file](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core/blob/development/sample/aidial.config.json) to view the full example.

```Json
//Example extract from aidial.config.json
"keys": {
    "proxyKey1": {
        "project": "Project1",
        "role": "default"
    }
},
"roles": {
    "default": { //role name
        "limits": {
            "chat-gpt-35-turbo": {}
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Authorization

You may want to specify limits for your API key role.

> Refer to [Limits](/Roles%20and%20Limits/overview#limits) to learn how to do this.
