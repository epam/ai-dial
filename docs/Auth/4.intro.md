# Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity. 

AI DIAL supports both web-based and programmatic authentication methods. For web-based authentication, we use JWT to verify users' identity, while for server-to-server interactions, we use API keys. 

## API Keys

AI DIAL utilizes API keys for server-to-server authentication. They are defined and stored in the configuration file of AI DIAL Core. By associating API keys with roles, you can control which resources they can access and set limits on their usage. This setup ensures secure and controlled access to your AI DIAL resources programmatically.

> Refer to [Tutorials](#) to learn how to create API keys and assign roles and limits for them.

### JWT

JSON Web Token (JWT) is used for web authentication to securely transmit information between a client and a server as a JSON object. When a user logs in, the identity service provider validates the credentials and returns a signed JWT to AI DIAL chat back-end. This JWT contains information about the user's identity. AI DIAL, allows to use various Identity Service Providers (IDPs) to manage user identities.

> Refer to [Tutorials](#) to learn how to integrate with the supported IDPs and create roles for JWT.
