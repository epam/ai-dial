## Standard Chat Interface Components

> **NOTE**: this user guide covers the functionality of a standard DIAL Chat UI.

The DIAL Chat application user interface has several main sections:

1. [Conversations](#conversations): Here, you can access and manage your conversations. You can collapse and expand the panel by clicking the **Hide panel** icon above it.
2. [Prompts](#prompts): In this section, you can work with prompts: create new templates, update them, and organize them in folders. You can collapse and expand the panel by clicking the **Hide panel** icon above it.
3. [Chat](#chat): Use this section to enter a prompt, view results, and interact with conversational agents.
4. [User Settings](#user-settings): In your user settings, you can customize the color theme (dark or light), replace the standard logo and access other UI customization options.
5. [Agents](#agents): you can view and change conversational agent before or during a conversation.
6. [Conversation settings](#conversation-settings): By default, this section displays the last conversational agent used by the user. In this section, you can modify settings of the selected agent or change the agent.
7. [DIAL Marketplace](#marketplace): Marketplace displays all conversational agents (applications and language models) available on your DIAL environment.
8. [My Workspace](#my-workspace): In My workspace, you can create applications and add agents from the Marketplace.
9. [Files](#files): Manager of files.

## Custom UI

> **NOTE**: this user guide covers the functionality of a standard DIAL Chat UI.

The standard DIAL Chat UI is designed to meet the needs of typical conversational applications.
However, to accommodate the requirements of applications that exceed the standard chat UI functionality, new application types can be introduced to implement a fully custom UI (even not chat-like UI), which can completely replace the standard chat interface during interactions with a specific application.

For example, [Mind Map](#mind-maps) applications implement fully custom UI that overrides the standard chat UI.

![](./img/mindmap2.png)

## Chat

The chat occupies the central part of the main screen, allowing you to input messages, see replies, and execute various supported tasks based on the application and chat settings.

![](./img/chat.png)

### Actions

**During a conversation**, you can perform various actions:

- [Work with prompts](#work-with-prompts)
- [Work with responses](#work-with-responses)
- [Work with attachments](#work-with-attachments)
- [Work with conversation settings](#work-with-conversation-settings)

#### Work with prompts

##### Enter prompts

You can enter your prompts in the text box. In [User Settings](#user-settings), you can configure the keyboard combination that will send the message.

![](./img/caht-box.png)

You can enter a prompt manually or select one of [existing prompts](#prompts). Enter `/` in the chat text box to select one of the available prompts. You can also click [Use](#use) in the prompt's menu to populate it in the text box or invoke a pop-up window where you can enter prompt variables.

##### Other actions

During a conversation, you can access several tools to work with prompts.

![](./img/edit-prompts.png)

- **Edit**: You can edit an existing prompt in the ongoing conversation. When editing, you can also edit the attached files if needed using drag-and-drop, CTRL+V or by selecting files in the Attachments Manager. After a prompt has been edited, the response is regenerated, and all your prompts after the edited one will be deleted.

  ![](./img/edit-prompts2.png)

- **Delete**: You can delete an existing prompt in the ongoing conversation. When you delete your prompt, the response will be deleted, too.
- **Set message template**: Use it to create a [parametrized conversation](#dynamic) using any message in your conversation as a template.

#### Work with responses

##### Copying responses

You can copy answers to reuse them some place else.

* Copy as plain text
* Copy in markdown format

![](./img/copy-answer.png)

##### Stop and Regenerate

In the process of generating the response, you can stop it by clicking a **Stop** icon in the text box.

![](./img/stop-generating.png)

When the response generation has been stopped, you can regenerate it. **Important**: If you encounter a server error or click the **Stop Generating** button and receive an empty response, the **Send** button will be disabled. To continue the conversation, you'll need to generate the answer again. If you receive a partial response (a combination of text and an error), the model can still proceed, while for Assistants/Applications, you'll need to generate the response again.

![](./img/regenerate.png)

##### Like/Dislike

You can like and dislike responses in a conversation. Use likes to highlight important responses and dislikes to mark the responses you don't find helpful or that are incorrect.

![](./img/like.png)

For a Dislike action, you will be prompted to enter a comment in a pop-up window.

![](./img/dislike.png)

#### Work with attachments

Some models and applications (e.g. _DIAL RAG_) support adding attachments (files, links, folders) to conversations. In this case, you'll see the **Attachments** icon available in the chat box. Click it to upload a file from your device or select an already uploaded file. You can also drag-and-drop files or use CTRL+V.

> Attached files are available in [Files](#files).

![](./img/attach.png)

##### Attaching folders

If the selected application supports this, you can click the attachment icon in the conversation box and select **Attach folders**.

> Note, that you can attach only folders available in [Files](#files) and cannot upload folders from an external source.

![](./img/attach-folder1.png)

In the pop-up window, select a checkbox for the folder you want to attach to your conversation. The attached folder will appear in the conversation box and become available for the application to work with.

##### Attaching links

If the selected application supports this, you can attach a link to a conversation to use it to generate responses:

1. Click the attachment icon in the conversation box and select **Attach link**.

   ![](./img/attach-link2.png)

2. Specify a valid URL and click **Attach**. The link will be displayed as attachment in the conversation box and become available for the application to work with.

   ![](./img/attach-link.png)

##### Attaching files

If the selected agent supports this, you can click the attachment icon in the conversation box and select **Attach uploaded files** or **Upload from device**. You can also _drag-and-drop_ files or use CTRL+V to paste files into the conversation box.

![](./img/attach-file2.png)

- Attach uploaded files: If you have already uploaded the necessary files, you can select them in [Files](#files).
- Upload from device: Select files you want to upload. Uploaded files you will be able to find in [Files](#files).

The file(s) will be displayed as attachment(s) in the conversation box and become available for the application to work with.

![](./img/attach-file.png)

##### View or download attachments

You can perform the following actions on attachments received in AI-generated responses:

- **Download**: Click the **Download** icon to save the attachment to your device.
- **Preview**: Click the **Down Arrow** icon to preview the attachment inline.
- **Full Screen**: Click the **Expand** icon to view graphics in full screen mode.

![](./img/download-file.png)

#### Work with conversation settings

On the top bar you can view and manage agent and conversation settings.

![](./img/chat-settings-bar.png)

> Refer to [Conversation Settings](#conversation-settings) to learn more.

### Isolated View Mode

In the Isolated View Mode, you can access the DIAL Chat in a simplified view mode with the predefined conversational agent. To access this mode, follow a specific URL `https://server/models/modelID` or `https://server/models/applicationID`. Conversation and prompt panels are not shown in this mode. All conversations that are created in this mode, will also be displayed in the standard chat view mode.

For instance, to open chat with GPT-4 model, go to `https://DIAL Chat URL/models/gpt-4` and access a streamlined user interface that only contains a chat input with GPT-4:

![](./img/isolated_view_mode.png)

Although this mode offers a simplified view, you can access [Conversation settings](#conversation-settings) the usual way.

## User Settings

In the user area on the top bar, click the dropdown arrow to access additional settings or sign out.

##### Available actions

- **Theme**: Select between the available chat themes. Refer to [Chat Themes](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-chat/blob/development/docs/THEME-CUSTOMIZATION.md) to learn more.
- **Custom Logo**: Select an image to display in the chat header.
- **Start chat with**: Select a default [agent](#agents) to start a chat with. You can select one of the available agents or applications.
- **Chat width**: Enable/disable full-width chat mode. In the full with chat mode, the chat text box occupies the full width of the screen.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Select the keyboard combination to send a message in the chat.

![](./img/user_settings.png)

## Conversations

In DIAL, a conversation is a dialogue between a conversational agent, such as a language model or application, and a human user. The agent uses natural language to interact with a human and receive/give a feedback. Within one conversation, you can refer to previous questions and answers. But different conversations don't share context.

> All your conversations are stored on the server, and you can access them from any device you use.

### Agents

In DIAL Chat you can have a conversation with agents: [language models](#models) and [applications](#applications). You can access all the available agents in [DIAL Marketplace](#marketplace) and add them to [your workspace](#my-workspace).

> Refer to [Agentic Platform](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md) to learn more about agents.

##### To change agent

By default, the main window displays the last agent used by the user. You can proceed and have a dialog with this agent or change it before starting a conversation or switch to a different one during the conversation:

Before you begin a conversation, click **Change agent** to invoke the **Select an agent for conversation** window. Here, you can choose among the added agents or navigate to My workspace section.

![](./img/change-agent.png)

In the middle of a conversation, you can view information about the current agent and change it by clicking the agent icon.

![](./img/change-agent2.png)

> **TIP**: You can also set the **default agent** you want to start a conversation with in your [User Settings](#user-settings).

### Conversation Settings

> **Note**: The conversation settings can vary based on the agent selected. It's possible that some agents might not have any configurable settings.

In the Conversation Settings, you can access and modify the following components depending on the selected agent:

- [System prompt](#system-prompt)
- [Temperature](#temperature)

You can modify the conversation settings before or during the conversation:

**Before** you begin a new conversation, click **Configure settings** in the main chat area to invoke the **Conversation settings** window.

![](./img/chat-settings-new.png)

**During** the conversation, in the conversation header you can view and modify conversation settings by clicking the **gear** icon.

In the conversation header menu you also can:

- View and change the current agent: you can view information about the current agent and change it by clicking the agent icon. Refer to [Agents](#agents) to learn more.
- Access conversation action menu: click the three-dot menu icon to access the standard conversation [actions menu](#actions).
- Clear conversation history: click the eraser icon to clear the conversation history and start from scratch.

![](./img/chat-settings.png)

#### System Prompt

> **Note**, there are language models that do not support this feature. In such cases system prompt is disabled.

The system prompt in DIAL acts as the initial set of instructions provided to the model. It serves as a compass for the model, guiding it through the conversational landscape to ensure it remains on track and stays aligned with the intended purpose and desired outcome of the conversation.

Type `/` in the text box to select any previously created prompt as a system prompt (for details, refer to the [Create](#create-1) in Prompts), and it will set the context and tone for the whole conversation.

![](./img/system_prompt.png)

#### Temperature

The temperature parameter controls the creativity and randomness of the model's output. A higher temperature (e.g., 1.0) makes the output more diverse and creative, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.1) makes the output more focused and deterministic.

![](./img/temperature.png)

Adjusting the temperature allows you to balance creativity and consistency in the generated response.

### Actions

Click a **...** icon to open a conversation menu. There, you can view a list of all possible actions for the chosen conversation.

![](./img/conversation-menu.png)

> **Note**, that the available actions can vary depending on the selected conversation. For example, the Unpublish action will not be available if the conversation hasn't been published yet.

This is the list of all the supported actions:

- [Select](#select-to-delete): use to select conversations you want to delete.
- [Rename](#rename) - use to rename a conversation.
- [Compare](#compare): use to compare conversations with different settings.
- [Duplicate](#duplicate): use to duplicate a shared conversation.
- [Replay](#replay): use to reproduce conversations but with different settings.
- [Playback](#playback): use to simulate the current conversation without any engagement with models.
- [Export](#export): use to export a conversation.
- [Move to](#arrange): use to relocate conversations.
- [Share](#share): use to share a conversation by providing a link or QR code.
- [Remove access](#remove-access): use to remove access to a shared by you conversation for all users.
- [Unshare](#unshare): use to remove a shared with you conversation from the list.
- [Publish](#publish): use to publish conversations.
- [Unpublish](#unpublish): use to revoke public access from published conversations.
- [Info](#info): use to view metadata of a selected conversation.
- [Delete](#delete): use to delete a single conversation.

![](./img/conv-menu.png)

### Arrange

You can organize your conversations into folders. To create a new folder, simply click on the folder icon located in the bottom menu:

![](./img/create-new-folder.png)

You can also create a new folder or move a conversation to the existing folder from the **Move to** context menu of the selected conversation. New folders will automatically be arranged in the **Pinned conversations** tab in the Conversations panel.

![](./img/pinned-conversations.png)

##### Hierarchy

You can create a hierarchy of folders with three nesting levels. Just create a folder and drag-n-drop it in the other folder to create a nesting level. The same way, you can either drag-n-drop a conversation into a folder or use **Move to** in the context menu of a conversation to move it to a **parent** folder.

> **Note**: empty folders are deleted after refreshing the page.

##### Naming conventions

The following symbols in the folders names are prohibited: tab, `"`, `:`, `;`, `/`, `\`, `,`, `=`, `{`, `}`, `%`, `&` and will be excluded. Note that you can use the `.` symbol at the start or inside a name, but the dot at the end will be automatically removed.

The MAX length of the folder name is limited to 160 symbols. Everything beyond is cut off.

### Search and Filter

Use the **Search** box to search conversations by their names. If you have any shared conversations, you can apply **Shared by me** filter to sort them out.

![](./img/search-conv.png)

### Create

There are several ways to initiate a dialog with a [conversational agent](#agents):

- To communicate with the current conversational agent (by default, the last one used by the user), simply begin typing in the text box located in the chat area.
- In My Workspace or Marketplace, select an agent and click **Use ...** button to initiate a conversation. Refer to [Converse](#use-1) to learn more.
- On the main chat screen, click the **Plus** icon to select agent and start a conversation.
- Applications can include starter buttons. You can use them to select a starting prompt for a new conversation. Refer to [Custom Buttons in Apps](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/1.custom-buttons.md) to see tutorials for developers on how to include custom buttons in applications.

![](./img/start-conv.png)

**Please be aware** that new conversations will show up in the conversations panel located to the left of the main chat area. However, if you start a conversation and close it while it is still empty, it will neither be displayed on the panel nor saved in your conversations.

### Rename

When you create a new conversation, it is automatically named after the first line in your first prompt. For instance, if your prompt consists of several sentences divided by a tab, the first sentence will be used as the conversation's name. Moreover, the MAX length of the conversation name is limited to 160 symbols. Everything beyond is cut off. After a conversation is created, you can rename it.

##### To rename a conversation

1. Click **Rename** in the context menu of the selected conversation.
2. Enter a new name and submit.

![](./img/rename-conversation.png)

##### Naming conventions

The following symbols in the conversation names are prohibited: tab, `"`, `:`, `;`, `/`, `\`, `,`, `=`, `{`, `}`, `%`, `&` and will be excluded. Note that you can use the `.` symbol at the start or inside a name, but the dot at the end will be automatically removed.

### Share

You can share a personal conversation or a folder with several conversations with other users. You can also receive a shared conversation.

**Important**: When a conversation is shared, all its attachments are shared as well and become available in [Files](#files).

> - Watch [Collaboration](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/3.dial-collaboration.md) demo video to learn more about sharing and other collaboration features in DIAL.
> - Refer to [Collaboration](/docs/platform/7.collaboration-intro.md#sharing) to learn more about sharing.

##### To receive a shared conversation

If a conversation has been shared with you, it can be located in the **Shared with me** section in the left panel.

![](./img/shared-with-me.png)

> **Important**: you cannot change a conversation that has been shared with you. To be able to work with it, [duplicate it](#duplicate).

##### To share a conversation

> **Note**: You can share entire folders with conversations. When you share a folder, all its folders and attachments will be shared as well.

If you want to share a conversation or a folder, click on **Share** in the contextual menu and send the link (or the QR code) to the intended recipient.

![](./img/share_conv.png)

After the recipient has opened your link, the arrow icon appears near its name. **Note**, it may be required to reload the page to update the status of the shared conversation.

![](./img/shared.png)

To filter and view only the conversations that you have shared, click on the **Shared by me** checkbox in the filter:

![](./img/shared-by-me.png)

### Remove access

To revoke access from all users you have shared with, click **Share** in the contextual menu and then click **Remove access for all users**.

![](./img/unshare_conv.png)

### Unshare

In the **Shared with me** section, you can find all conversations that were shared with you. Use **Unshare** in the conversations actions menu to remove selected conversations from this list.

![](./img/unshare-conversation.png)

### Duplicate

Duplicate a shared with you conversation to be able to change it. To duplicate a conversation, click **Duplicate** in the contextual menu.

> This feature is available only for conversations shared with you.

![](./img/duplicate_conv.png)

### Export

You can export conversations. If a conversation includes attachments, you can export it with or without attachments.

You can also export all your conversations at once without attachments in a JSON format.

> Exported conversations are named by the following pattern: prefix "epam_ai_dial_chat", then "with_attachments" if the conversation was exported with attachments, then "month_day". However, the naming convention is configurable in the chat config.

##### Export a single conversation with attachments

1. On the left panel, in the conversation contextual menu, point to **Export**.
2. Click **With attachments**.

The conversation will be exported as a **ZIP** archive. Please note that the name of the ZIP archive follows the format `file_name.dial`. You can manage it just like a normal ZIP archive.

![](./img/export-with-att.png)

##### Export a single conversation without attachments

1. On the left panel, in the conversation contextual menu, point to **Export**.
2. Click **Without attachments**.

The conversation will be exported as a **JSON** file.

![](./img/export-without-att.png)

##### Export all conversations

To export all conversations, at the bottom of the left panel, click the **Export conversations** icon.

> Conversations will be exported without attachments.

![](./img/export_all.png)

### Import

Exported conversations can be imported.

To import a JSON file with a conversation or a ZIP archive with several conversations (may include attachments as well), click the **Import conversations** icon at the bottom of the left panel and then select a file with conversations.

![](./img/import_conv.png)

When you import a conversation with attachments, the attachments will be available in the parent of the root folder in [Files](#files).

When importing a **duplicate** of an existing conversation, you will be prompted to select one of the proceeding options for both the conversation and each of the attachments:

- Replace - replace the original conversation/attachment
- Ignore - do nothing
- Postfix - add a postfix to the imported conversation/attachment. For example: _my-conversation 1_ , where 1 is added postfix to the name of the duplicated imported conversation.

![](./img/import-export.png)

### Info

Click **Info** in the conversation menu to view the conversation metadata: the date it was updated and the creation date.

![](./img/conv-info.png)

### Delete

You can delete a single conversation, selected conversations or all conversations.

- To delete a **single** conversation, on the left panel, in the conversation contextual menu, select **Delete** and confirm your action.
- To delete **all** conversations, at the bottom of the left panel, click the **Delete all conversations** icon.

![](./img/delete-conversation.png)

### Select to Delete

Also, you can use a _selection_ mode to choose conversation(s) you want to delete:

- Click **Select all** button in the bottom panel. When you do this, all conversations get preselected and you can unselect the ones you want to **keep**. You can also click **Unselect all** in the bottom panel to clear the selection.

![](./img/select-chat1.png)

- Click **Select** in the conversation menu to enter into a _selection_ mode. In this mode, you can hover over any conversation and use checkboxes to select/unselect conversations you want to delete. You can also click **Unselect all** in the bottom panel to clear the selection.

![](./img/select-chat2.png)

### Replay

You can use **Replay** to reproduce conversations but with different settings (e.g. a different model). A replayed conversation can be used to compare responses to the same questions from different models and with different settings of the conversation.

![](./img/replay-conversation.png)

Use **Replay as is** to reproduce the conversation with the original settings. You can find Replay as is if you click **Change agent** or an agent icon in the conversation header menu.

![](./img/Replay_as_is.png)

##### To replay a conversation

1. Click **Replay** in the conversation menu.
2. Click **Start replay**.
3. In the process of replaying, you can stop and resume the replay process using controls in the text box **Stop generating** and **Continue replay** respectively.

![](./img/continue-replay.png)

The replayed conversation is displayed as a new conversation with the `[Replay]` tag in the list of your conversations.

![](./img/replay1.png)

### Parameterized Replay

You can use Parameterized Replay to create your own chats or stories with custom variables and share them with your team. Such parametrized conversations others can follow, but with their own details or answers to create a personalized experience. This makes chat a much more useful tool for sharing information and collaboration.

##### Prompt-based

You can create a parametrized conversation using a special prompt with variables.

Let's create a simple Travel Guide conversation, which will take a user though several steps to clarify information and provide the answer.

1. Start by [creating a special prompt](#create-1) with [variables](#variables). Use templates (this `{{VariableName|DefaultValue}}` or this `{{VariableName}}`) to add variables into your prompt with or without default values. For example: `I'd like to travel to {{country|Japan}}. Could you please suggest {{num-attractions|10}} of the best attractions? I will be there for {{num-days}}. Thank you.`
2. To use your parametrized prompt, type `/` in the conversation text input area and select your prompt. You will be asked to provide your inputs for variables in a pop-up window. Enter your inputs and click `Submit`. The prompt is now populated with your inputs in the conversation text box. Send message to start.
3. The chat will return its response to your prompt.
4. You can now click [Replay](#replay) in your conversation's menu to repeat this dialogue but with different input parameters.
5. You can [Share](#share) this conversation with someone. When a person opens the shared conversation, they will be prompted to fill in their personal input in the parameterized prompt, allowing them to have the same conversation but with their custom inputs, for example, travel to USA instead of Japan.

##### Dynamic

You can create a parametrized conversation from any message in your chat. This scenario does not require having any pre-configured prompts.

> Watch a [demo video](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/5.dial-parameterized-replay.md) to see it in action.

1. Within a conversation, you can set any message as a template for subsequent replay. Use **Set message template** to invoke the **Message template** window.

   ![](./img/param-replay-icon.png)

2. In the **Message template** window, you can substitute sections of your original message with [variables](#variables) under the **Set template** tab. To achieve this, copy a segment from your original message and paste it into the first input box. Then, in the second input box, introduce a variable using the format: `{{Variable name}}`. For instance, in our example, we have replaced "France" with the `{{Country}}` variable.

   ![](./img/param-replay-form.png)

   In the **Preview** tab, you can preview your original message with variables:

   ![](./img/param-replay-form-preview.png)

3. Once you click save, you can return to your conversation. In the conversation menu, select [Replay](#replay) to initiate the replay of this conversation. The chat will prompt you to input values for your variable(s) to replay the conversation. You have the option to replay it as it originally was (using the same model as in your initial conversation) - select **Replay as is** (you can find it if you click **Change agent**), or you can alter the settings of the conversation to experiment with different models and parameters.
4. You can [Share](#share) this conversation with others. When someone opens the shared conversation, they will be prompted to provide their own inputs in the template. This allows experiencing the same conversation but with personalized inputs, such as traveling to the USA instead of France.

### Playback

The Playback mode can be used to simulate the current conversation without any engagement with models. This mode accurately reproduces the conversation like a recording.

> - **Note**, that this differs from [Replay](#replay), where the prompts are resubmitted to the chosen model and the outcomes may differ from the initial conversation.
> - **Note**: playback support in [schema-rich applications](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#schema-rich-applications) can be enabled/disabled in the application's JSON schema using `dial:applicationTypePlaybackSupport` property.

![](./img/playback-conversation.png)

During playback, you have the ability to rewind, fast forward, or halt the process.

![](./img/playback-controls.png)

### Compare

Use the Compare mode to compare two new (or two existing) conversations with different setting (e.g. different models or temperature).

##### To compare two NEW conversations

1. Click the **Compare** icon in the menu at the bottom of the left panel.
2. Define settings for both conversations. To do that, click **Configure settings** for any conversation to open a dialog window.
3. Type your question (prompt) in the chat box to begin.

![](./img/compare-3.png)

Once you initiate a conversation in this mode, the system creates two new conversations with the same name but adds numbers to them. If you have chosen different language models, the conversations icons will differ accordingly.

![](./img/compare-4.png)

##### To compare two EXISTING conversations

> **Important**: this Compare mode works only with conversations with the same amount of prompts from a user. The application will not allow comparing two conversations with different amounts of prompts.

1. On the left panel, in the conversation menu of a conversation, select **Compare**.
2. In the main section, under **Select conversation to compare with**, select the second conversation from the drop box.
3. By default, only conversations with the same name are available in the drop box. Select **Show all conversations** to see the full list of conversations.
4. Type your question (prompt) in the chat box.

![](./img/compare.png)

### Publish

You can publish conversations to make them available for the target audience. Refer to [Publications](#publications) section of this guide to learn more about publications.

**Note**: to publish a shared conversation, [duplicate](#duplicate) it and then publish.

**Important**: all publication request undergo review by administrators, who can modify or decline it.

> Watch [Publications](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/4.dial-publications.md) demo video to learn more about collaboration features in DIAL.

##### To publish a conversation

1. Click **Publish** in the conversation menu.

![](./img/publish-conversation.png)

2. In the pop-up window:

   - Enter **publication request name** in the upper area.
   - In **Publish to**, you can select the target destination. You can also create a dedicated folder to publish your conversation into.
   - Enter the name of the author of the publication request.
   - In **Allow access..**, specify access rules and the target audience. For example Role-Equals-Admin. **Note**: the available roles are configured for each organization individually. Contact your support to find out the rules are applicable in your organization.
   - In **Conversations**, you can choose what conversations you want to publish (if you have selected a folder with several conversations). If conversations include attachments, you can also select them in the **Files** section.
   - Assign a version to your request.
   - Click **Send request** to send your publish request to the administrator.
     ![](./img/publish-request.png)

3. When your request is approved, the published conversation or a folder with conversation(s) will become available in the Organization tab.

##### Versioning

When you make a publication request, it is required to assign it a unique version number. A version must follow format: `0.0.0`. With each request you must provide a new version - the system will not accept two identical versions.

Versioning helps you create specific publications for different groups of people, run experiments, and keep track of your conversations easily.

You can add a **version** of your publication request next to the conversation check box:

![](./img/versioning1.png)

If you try to publish this conversation again, you will be able to view the last version or a drop-down with versions:

![](./img/versioning2.png)

When you open a published conversation, you can view and switch between its versions in the [conversation settings](#conversation-settings):

![](./img/versioning3.png)

### Unpublish

   - Click **Send request** to send your unpublish request to the administrator.

   ![](./img/unpublish-request.png)

3. When your request is approved by the administrator, the unpublished conversation or a folder with conversation(s) will become unavailable in the Organization tab.

## Prompts

A prompt is an instruction, a question, or a message that a user provides to a language model to receive an answer. Prompts can also contain constraints or requirements. They help the model understand the task at hand and the types of responses that are expected.
You can use prompts as templates for your messages, instructions to the model, or to encourage the model to generate specific types of content.
In DIAL, you can create prompts beforehand and reuse them in one or several conversations.

Prompts can be applied to one message or a whole conversation. Refer to the [System prompt](#system-prompt) section of this guide for details.

The section with your prompts is located in the right-hand area of the screen. In this section, you can work with saved prompts: create new templates, update them, and organize them with folders.

> All your prompts are stored on the server, and you can access them from any device you use.

### Actions

Click a **...** icon to open a prompt menu. There, you can find a list of all the available actions for the selected prompt.

![](./img/prompt-menu.png)

![](./img/prompt_actions.png)

### Arrange

You can organize your prompts in folders. To create a new folder, click on the folder icon in the bottom menu:

![](./img/create-new-folder-prompt.png)

You can also create a new folder or move a prompt to the existing folder from the **Move to** context menu of the selected prompt:

![](./img/move_prompt.png)

New folders will automatically be arranged in the **Pinned prompts** tab in the Prompts panel.

![](./img/pinned-prompts.png)

##### Hierarchy

You can create a hierarchy of folders with three nesting levels. Just create a folder and drag-n-drop it in the other folder to create a nesting level. The same way, you can either drag-n-drop a prompt into a folder or use **Move to** in the context menu of a prompt to move it to a **parent** folder.

> **Note**: empty folders are deleted after refreshing the page.

##### Naming conventions

The following symbols in the folders names are prohibited: tab, `"`, `:`, `;`, `/`, `\`, `,`, `=`, `{`, `}`, `%`, `&` and will be excluded. Note that you can use the `.` symbol at the start or inside a name, but the dot at the end will be automatically removed.

The MAX length of the folder name is limited to 160 symbols. Everything beyond is cut off.

### Search and Filter

Use the **Search** box to search prompts by their names. If you have any shared prompts, you can apply **Shared by me** filter to sort them out.

![](./img/view-prompt.png)

### Create

##### To create a new prompt

1. On the right panel, select **New prompt**.
2. Fill in the **Name**, **Description**, and **Prompt** boxes. The following symbols in the prompt names are prohibited: tab, `:`, `;`, `/`, `\`, `,`, `=`, `{`, `}`, `%`, `&`. Note that you can use the `.` symbol at the start or inside a name, but the dot at the end will be automatically removed. The MAX length of the prompt name is limited to 160 symbols. Everything beyond is cut off.
3. Click **Save**.

> While both the **Name** and **Description** fields are required to create a prompt, they do not serve as instructions for the language model. They simply help you differentiate this prompt from others. The language model will only utilize instructions from the **Prompt** box.

![](./img/create-pt.png)

#### Variables

You can use prompts as templates for your instructions to a language model. You can also add variables in your prompts. Use notation such as `{{variableName}}` or `{{variableName|Default Value}}` to add variables.

> Refer to [Parameterized Replay](#parameterized-replay) to view a use case when prompts are used to create parametrized conversations.

For example, you need to calculate an equation `a + b/c`, round up the answer, and then divide it by 4.

Create the following prompt:

`{{a}}+{{b}}/{{c}}=`

Round up the answer to three digits and divide by four

![](./img/math-prompt1.png)

Here, `a`, `b`, and `c` are variables. In the prompt body, they are denoted by double curly brackets: `{{ }}`.

> You can combine mathematical expressions and natural language in your prompts.

After you have created the prompt, you can use it by typing a slash `/` in the chat box and selecting the name of a prompt (it is **Math** in our example). You’ll see the following form where you can enter any numbers:

![](./img/math-prompt.png)

When you submit the form, your message will look like on the illustration below:

![](./img/math-prompt3.png)

Generally, variables can be anything, not only numbers. For example, you can create a prompt with the following body: `Who played {{character}} in {{movie}}? or What is a Latin name of {{plant common name}}?`

#### Application Types

DIAL functions as an application server offering tools to develop, deploy, host and manage different types of GenAI applications. It supports GenAI applications developed on the DIAL platform as well as non-conversational apps created with other technologies, including any LLM framework, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, vector databases, and more.

> Refer to [App Server](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/5.app-server.md) to learn more.

Applications that follow the DIAL Unified protocol are known as DIAL-native apps. The standard DIAL Chat UI is designed to meet the needs of these apps. However, your DIAL environment can also include non-conversational apps that use custom UIs, which override the standard DIAL Chat UI. Such cases are not covered in this user guide.

> Refer to [DIAL-Native Apps](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md) to see a more in-depth information about applications and application types.

:cloud: DIAL SaaS version includes several predefined application types: Quick Apps, Code Apps and Mind Maps. Application types serve as templates for creating applications of predefined types. Application types included in SaaS edition, also provide [low and no-code Application Wizards](#application-builder) for end users to be able to create applications

:floppy_disk: Self-hosted DIAL setups can include custom application types with fully custom UIs overriding the standard DIAL Chat UI and custom UIs for application wizards. Custom UIs are out of scope of this user guide.

#### Use

##### Interact with application

In My workspace, you can select which application you want to use.

1. Click any application.

> - Refer to [App Server](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/5.app-server.md) to discover DIAL features for creating apps and managing them throughout the lifecycle.

#### Quick Apps

Quick Apps is a no-code orchestrator conceptually similar to OpenAI's GPTs that simplifies the creation of multi-agent workflows. In Quick Apps, you can use AI agents, MCP toolsets, REST APIs, language models and other tools available in the DIAL ecosystem as building blocks to create applications.

Quick Apps can be used to simplify a workflow or carry out a specific task. For example, you can create an app with a toolset allowing it to call an external API to get a real-time weather forecast for a specific location. Another example is a RAG-like application that can generate responses based on predefined sources.

![](./img/app-builder.png)

#### Edit

When you add a new application, it is stored in the private folder dedicated to your user. Private applications are under a complete control of the application author, who can edit or delete them anytime.

When you [publish an application](#publish-2), a specific version of it appears in the public folder. You cannot modify the published version of the application. But you can continue working on the application in the private space and, if needed, publish new versions of it.

> Refer to [Access Control](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/6.access-control.md) to learn more about private and public spaces.

##### To edit application

> **Note**: you can edit only **your own** apps. Undeploy Code app to be able to [Edit it](#to-edit-code-app).

1. In your workspace, click **Edit** in the application's card actions menu to invoke the application editor.
2. Make changes and click **Save**.

![](./img/edit-app.png)

#### Share

Applications in the private space are available only to the application author. To enable access for specific users, application author can generate a sharing link.

In this section, you can learn about:

- [Sharing](#to-share-app)
- [Unsharing](#unshare)
- [Removing access](#to-remove-access)
- [Editing rights](#sharing-with-editing-rights)

##### To share app

Use **Share** to grant other users rights to use your application. You can repeat the procedure described in this section more than once to share with different users.

> **Note**, that you can share only your own applications. You cannot share an application that has been shared with you, unless [re-sharing](/docs/platform/7.collaboration-intro.md#sharing) rights have been explicitly granted.

1. Click **Share** on the application's card actions menu.

![](./img/share-app.png)

2. If necessary, you can select a specific version of the application you want to share.
3. In the pop-up dialog window, select whether you want to give editing rights with the sharing link. **Important**: if you grant editing rights to your app, make sure you are familiar with the [main principles](#sharing-with-editing-rights) outlined in this documentation.
4. Confirm the action in the dialog window.
5. Provide the sharing link (or a QR code) to the user with whom you want to share your app.

A shared application (or its version if only a specific version has been shared) is labeled with the blue arrow:

![](./img/share-app3.png)

##### Access to application files

Applications can rely on resources like documents and files to operate. When the application is shared, the resources it includes are shared as well. You can see files that have been shared along with applications in [Files](#files) under the "Shared with me" section. You can Unshare shared files to remove them from this list.

If an application was shared with you **with editing rights** (e.g., a Code App with its source code files), you can access its files in the Attachments Manager under the "Shared with me" section. With editing rights, you can **delete** specific source files via the actions menu.

> Refer to [Access to Application Files](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/3.enable-app.md#access-to-application-files) to see a more in-depth and technical description of a logic that handles access to files of shared applications.

##### Sharing with editing rights

The key distinction between sharing and [publishing](#publish-2) is that sharing allows you to grant not only the rights to use but also editing access to your application.

**Important**: when an application (or its specific version) is shared, any updates made to the app become immediately available to the users with whom the application has been shared, but it's important to note that **conflict resolution** for simultaneous edits by multiple users is not supported, so the changes submitted first will be applied to the shared application for all users immediately.

Applications shared with and without editing rights have different scope of actions available for the target user. For example, users with editing rights can edit, deploy or undeploy applications.

![](./img/share-app2.png)

##### To remove access

> **Note**: a shared application is revoked from the shared usage when the apps's name or version is modified by the application owner.

You can revoke access for all users with whom you have shared the application.

1. Select the shared application for which you want to revoke access. You can identify the shared apps by the blue arrow pinned to the icon of the shared application.
2. Click **Share** in the applications menu.
3. In the open dialog window, click **Remove access for all users** and confirm the action in the pop-up window.

![](./img/revoke.png)

#### Unshare

Use **Unshare** to remove the shared with you application from your workspace.

> **TIP**: To quickly find all apps that have been shared with you, use the **Source** filter in My workspace.

1. In the shared application's menu, click **Unshare**.
2. Confirm the action in the dialog window.

![](./img/share-app4.png)

#### Publish

Until published, your application is stored in the dedicated folder of your user and cannot be accessed by anybody. You can publish your application to make it accessible to the selected audience in your organization. Published application is available on [Marketplace](#marketplace) for the target audience.

**Important**: all publication request undergo [review by administrators](#process-publish-requests), who can modify or decline it.

> - Refer to [Publications](#publications) to learn more about this functionality and to [DevOps Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/1.configuration/1.enable-publications-chat.md) to learn how to enable publications in DIAL.
> - Refer to [Access Control](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md) to learn more about public resources and how to restrict access to them.

##### To publish application

1. In the application menu (you can also find a Publish icon in the Edit application form), click **Publish**.
2. Enter **publication request name** in the upper area.
3. In **Publish to**, select the target destination or a folder to publish your application into.
4. In **Allow access...**, specify access rules for the target folder and the authorized audience. For example Role-Equals-Admin. **Note**: the available roles are defined in each organization individually. Contact your support to find out the rules are applicable in your organization.
5. In **Applications** you can choose what applications you want to publish.
6. Assign a **version** to the published application.
7. Enter the name of the **author** of the publication request.
8. Click **Send request** to send your publication request to the administrator.

![](./img/register-app3.png)

##### To continue working on the original application after publication

Keep in mind, that after publishing, another instance of the application is created. On the Marketplace, you can find both of them: the original (the one that is stored in your private folder) and the published one (stored in the public folder).

The original application has the editor icon on it - meaning that your can [continue modifying this app](#edit). You can edit your application and publish another updated version of it.

If you wan to use the application version that you have published, find it on the Marketplace, bookmark to [add to your workspace](#add-to-my-workspace) to use it. Published version of the application cannot be modified anymore - you can just unpublish it to withdraw from usage.

![](./img/published-app.png)

##### Access to application files

Applications can rely on resources like documents and files to operate. When the application is published, the resources it includes are published as well. You can access the resources of the published application in [Files](#files) under the "Organization" section.

> Refer to [Access to Application Files](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/3.enable-app.md#access-to-application-files) to see a more in-depth and technical description of a logic that handles access to files of published applications.

#### Unpublish

The published application can be unpublished by the application owner or the DIAL administrator. When unpublished, the application stops being available on the Marketplace and is removed from the public folder.

##### To unpublish application

1. Find a published application on the Marketplace using filters Type=Applications and Sources=Public.
2. In the applications actions menu, select **Unpublish** and fill in the request form.
3. The application will be withdrawn from the public usage after the [unpublish request](#to-unpublish-a-published-application) is approved by the DIAL administrator.

#### Remove

You can remove applications from your workspace at any time using the bookmark button in the application's card:

![](./img/remove-app-from-workspace.png)

#### Delete

Use Delete in the app's menu to completely delete the selected application. **Note** that you can delete only your own apps and apps versions that have not been published.

##### To delete application

1. In your workspace, select one of your own apps that you want to delete.
2. Click **Delete** in the application card's actions menu.
3. Confirm your action in the dialog window.

![](./img/register-app4.png)

#### Application Link

For applications that are available organization-wide, you can copy and share a link that directs users straight to the application's card in the DIAL Marketplace, facilitating quick and easy navigation.

![](./img/app-link.png)

### Toolsets

Toolsets are connectors with MCP servers that you can use as tools in [Quick Apps 2.0](#add-quick-app-20) to perform specific actions in your custom workflows.

In DIAL Marketplace you can find all toolsets available on your DIAL environment. Each user can access only those toolsets that are available to their [user role](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md#roles-as-subjects).

In [your workspace](#my-workspace), you can access toolsets added on the Marketplace screen and add new toolsets.

#### Authentication

If the toolset you’ve chosen requires authentication, you’ll have to sign in before you can use it.

For example, if you’re using an application that relies on the MCP toolset and authentication is required, you won’t be able to access it unless you’re logged in. In this situation, the application will display an error message prompting you to authenticate before proceeding.

Therefore, make sure you are authenticated with toolsets you are about to use.

If you are not logged in, the toolset card displays the LOGGED OUT label:

![](./img/toolset-logged-out.png)

If you are logged into your own toolset with your credentials, the card of the authenticated toolset displays the label MY CREDS:

![](./img/toolset-logged-in.png)

If a toolset was [published with credentials](#to-publish-toolset-with-creds), it may be automatically logged in and display the **ORG CREDS** label. DIAL administrators can also [log in with organization credentials](#manage-creds) to make a toolset available to all users within the organization:

![](./img/toolset-logged-in-with-creds.png)

A toolset that does not require authentication does not display any label on its card:

![](./img/no-auth-toolset.png)

##### To log into your own toolset

1. Select one of your won toolsets that requires authentication and click **Log in** in the actions menu. You can also find the **Login** button if you click the toolset card to see the details.
2. Proceed with authentication at the MCP server provider as configured in the toolset.

![](./img/toolset-login2.png)

##### To log into a public toolset

A toolset can be [published with login credentials](#to-publish-toolset-with-creds).

There can be two cases: a public toolset can be logged in and not.

- If a public toolset is logged in, the ORG CREDS label is displayed on its card. You can use it right away without any additional actions or you can log in with your own credentials.
- If a public toolset is not logged in, the LOGGED OUT label is displayed on its card. Click **Login with my creds** to log in and use the toolset.

![](./img/toolset-login.png)

##### To log out

1. Select the toolset where you have logged in and click **Log out** in the actions menu.
2. Confirm action to log out.

##### Flow

This is the high level overview of the publication workflow:

1. A chat user sends a publication request for the selected resource(s) ([conversation](#publish), [prompt](#publish-1), [application](#publish-2)).
2. An [admin](#administrators) receives the publication request, reviews it and either approves or declines. Refer to [Process Publish Requests](#process-publish-requests) to learn more. Note, that admin can also modify the publication request, including access rules.
3. In case the publication request has been approved, the published resources (conversations and prompts) become available for the target audience in the Organization section in the chat application. Published applications can be found in [DIAL Marketplace](#marketplace). If the published conversation or application includes attachments or other resources (e.g. Quick apps can include documents for RAG), they will be available in [Files](#files) under the Organization section.
4. Resource owner (or administrator) can unpublish the published resource.

> Refer to [Conversations](#publish), [Prompts](#publish-1) and [Publish App](#publish-2) to view step-by-step instructions.

## Administrators

Users with the admin role have the following privileges:

- Have `READ` and `WRITE` access to all system resources (conversations, prompts, models, toolsets and applications) with the exception of private resources of users.
- Can view, approve, modify and reject publication requests from DIAL users.
- Have access to all DIAL Core API endpoints.

> Refer to [Access Control](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md) to learn more about dial admins and access to DIAL resources.

##### DIAL Chat for Admins

DIAL Chat has specific sections available only for logged-in administrators where they can process publication requests, access and manage published resources.

> Watch a [video demo](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/3.dial-collaboration.md) to see it in action.

##### Admin Panel

Beyond the section for administrators in DIAL Chat, DIAL includes Admin Panel application for administrators.

> - Refer to [Admin Panel](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/home.md) to see the comprehensive user guide of the application for system administrators.
> - Watch a [video demo](/docs/video%20demos/4.dial-admin-panel.md) to see Admin Panel in action.

### Process Publish Requests

Users with the admin role have access to the **Approve required** tab in conversations and prompts sections, where they can view all publish and unpublish requests from users.

- The **Approve required** tab with publication requests for **applications** and **prompts** appear in the Prompts section.
- The **Approve required** tab with publication requests for **conversation** appears in the Conversations section.

![](./img/admin-panel.png)

The counter shows the number of requests to be reviewed. Each such request has a color dot attached to it.

> **TIP**: Refresh your browser to update this information.

#### Review

All publication requests undergo a review process by administrators before being published. As a result of a review process, a request can be either approved or declined by the administrator. Administrators can also modify a publication request or select what parts to approve.

1. Click on any publication request to open a review window.
2. In the review window, you can preview the details of the request and download attached files, if present. **Note**, that a request can include both publish and unpublish requests. The latter is highlighted in red color in the list of conversations or prompts. Such mixed requests can be currently realized exclusively using DIAL API.

   ![](./img/unpublish-request-admin.png)

3. Administrators can edit request details with the exception of the author and the creation timestamp. Click **Edit** to modify the request.

   ![](./img/edit-publication-request.png)

4. A publication request may include nested files or folders. All attached assets are enabled by default. Administrators can select what assets to include in the publication request.

   ![](./img/publish-part-of-request.png)

5. If **Go to a review...** is displayed, click it to review the request. For the unfinished review, this button changes to **Continue review...**.

   **Note**, you cannot approve the request which has not been reviewed in full.

   ![](./img/review-mode.png)

6. In the review mode, you can use arrows to navigate between conversations/prompts and click **Back to publication request** when finished reviewing. **Note**, this is disabled for application publication request.

   ![](./img/review-mode2.png)

   You can also edit the conversation you are reviewing. In the editing mode, the chat text box appears allowing you to enter new messages, add or remove files in the conversation flow. If a conversation/application that you are reviewing has files attached to it, they are placed in the review bucket in the file storage and are available in the **Review files** section of the attachments manager in the current conversation's chat box.

   ![](./img/review-files.png)

7. Once the review is completed, the **Approve** button is enabled.

### Deploy and Undeploy Code Apps

In the [DIAL Marketplace](#marketplace), administrators can deploy and undeploy Code Apps of different users.

1. Go to DIAL Marketplace and apply filter by Applications. Deployed Code Apps have a green status icon.
2. Click the app you want to undeploy/deploy. Refer to [Code Apps/Deploy](#deploy) to learn more.

### Unpublish

Applications, conversations and prompts published via DIAL Core API or DIAL Chat UI can be unpublished by DIAL administrators and resource owners to withdraw them from public usage. When unpublished, a resource is no longer available in the public space.

> **Note**: Applications added via a direct modification of the DIAL Core config also appear in the public space and DIAL Marketplace but cannot be unpublished by DIAL administrators using DIAL Chat UI, Admin panel or DIAL Core API. Refer to [Access Control](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md#objects) to learn more about such resources.

> Refer to Unpublish Conversation, Unpublish Prompt and Unpublish Application to learn how this can be done by DIAL Chat users.

##### To unpublish a published conversation

1. In the Conversations area, open the **Organization** tab to see all published conversations.
2. Select a conversation and click **Unpublish** in the [actions menu](#actions) and fill in the [request form](#unpublish).
3. The conversation will be removed from the Organization folder after the unpublish request is approved by the DIAL administrator.

> **Note**, you can unpublish not only single conversations, but also published folders with conversations. In this case, you can select what conversations in the folder you want to unpublish.

##### To unpublish a published prompts

1. In the Prompts area, open the **Organization** tab to see all published prompts.

## Data Visualization

DIAL Chat enables data visualization for specific data types using data visualizers. It comes with built-in support for the [Plotly data visualizer](#plotly). To link any other custom visualizers, you can use the [DIAL Chat Visualizer Connector](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-chat/blob/development/libs/chat-visualizer-connector/README.md) library.

> Refer to [Data Visualization](/docs/platform/4.chat/2.data-visualization-intro.md) to learn more about visualizing data in chat and custom visualization apps.

### Plotly

Plotly is an open-source JavaScript library that enables the creation of diverse data visualizations, including charts, 3D graphs, and more.

![](./img/plotly.png)

> - Refer to [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) to learn more.
> - Watch [Animated Scatterplot](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/6.animated-scatterplot.md) demo video to see how statistical data can be visualized in DIAL Chat using a Plotly animated scatterplot.
> - Watch [Omics AI Assistant](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/7.dial-omics-assistant.md) demo video to see how protein structures can be visualized with Plotly.

DIAL Chat integrates with Plotly, offering robust data visualization capabilities. To utilize Plotly, choose an DIAL application that supports this feature. These applications must be capable of querying data (either from a URL or directly from the Chat application) based on user input and returning it in a format compatible with Plotly. Chat automatically detects attachments in this format and uses Plotly to visualize the data.

![](./img/plotly2.png)

The visualizations come with standard Plotly controls for easy manipulation.

> Refer to [Plotly GitHub](https://github.com/plotly/react-plotly.js) to learn more.
