## Standard Chat Interface Components

> **NOTE**: this user guide covers the functionality of a standard AI DIAL Chat UI.

The AI DIAL Chat application user interface has several main sections:

1. [Conversations](#conversations): Here, you can access and manage your conversations. You can collapse and expand the panel by clicking the **Hide panel** icon above it.
2. [Prompts](#prompts): In this section, you can work with prompts: create new templates, update them, and organize them in folders. You can collapse and expand the panel by clicking the **Hide panel** icon above it.
3. [Chat](#chat): Use this section to enter a prompt, view results, and interact with conversational agents.
4. [User Settings](#user-settings): In your user settings, you can customize the color theme (dark or light), replace the standard logo and access other UI customization options.
5. [Agents](#agents): you can view and change conversational agent before or during a conversation.
6. [Conversation settings](#conversation-settings): By default, this section displays the last conversational agent used by the user. In this section, you can modify settings of the selected agent or change the agent.
7. [DIAL Marketplace](#marketplace): Marketplace displays all conversational agents (applications, language models and assistants) available on your DIAL environment. In My workspace, you can gather conversational agents that you want to be at hand and add custom applications.

![](./img/home.png)

## Custom UI

> **NOTE**: this user guide covers the functionality of a standard AI DIAL Chat UI.

The standard AI DIAL Chat UI is designed to meet the needs of typical conversational applications.
However, to accommodate the requirements of applications that exceed the standard chat UI functionality, new application types can be introduced to implement a fully custom UI (even not chat-like UI), which can completely replace the standard chat interface during interactions with a specific application.

![](./img/mindmap2.png)


## Conversations

In the AI DIAL, a conversation is a dialogue between a conversational agent, such as a language model, assistant, or application, and a human user. The agent uses natural language to interact with a human and receive/give a feedback. Within one conversation, you can refer to previous questions and answers. But different conversations don't share context.

> All your conversations are stored on the server, and you can access them from any device you use.

### Agents

In AI DIAL Chat you can have a conversation with several types of agents: language models, applications and assistants. You can access all the available agents in [DIAL Marketplace](#dial-marketplace) and add them to [My workspace](#my-workspace). Refer to [Conversational Agents](#conversational-agents) to learn more about them.

##### To change agent

By default, the main window displays the last agent used by the user. You can proceed and have a dialog with this agent or change it before starting a conversation or switch to a different one during the conversation:

Before you begin a conversation, click **Change agent** to invoke the **Select an agent for conversation** window. Here, you can choose among the added agents or navigate to My workspace section.

![](./img/change-agent.png)

In the middle of a conversation, you can view information about the current agent and change it by clicking the agent icon. 

![](./img/change-agent2.png)

### Conversation Settings

> **Note**: The conversation settings can vary based on the agent selected. It's possible that some agents might not have any configurable settings.

In the Conversation Settings, you can access and modify the following components depending on the selected agent:

- [System prompt](#system-prompt)
- [Temperature](#temperature)
- [Addons](#addons)

You can modify the conversation settings before or during the conversation:

**Before** you begin a new conversation, click **Configure settings** in the main chat area to invoke the **Conversation settings** window.

![](./img/chat-settings-new.png)

**During** the conversation, in the conversation header you can view and modify conversation settings by clicking the **gear** icon.

In the conversation header menu you also can: 

* View and change the current agent: you can view information about the current agent and change it by clicking the agent icon. Refer to [Agents](#agents) to learn more.
* Access conversation action menu: click the three-dot menu icon to access the standard conversation [actions menu](#actions).
* Clear conversation history: click the eraser icon to clear the conversation history and start from scratch. 

![](./img/chat-settings.png)

#### System Prompt

> **Note**, there are language models that do not support this feature. In such cases system prompt is disabled. 

The system prompt in AI DIAL acts as the initial set of instructions provided to the model. It serves as a compass for the model, guiding it through the conversational landscape to ensure it remains on track and stays aligned with the intended purpose and desired outcome of the conversation.

Type `/` in the text box to select any previously created prompt as a system prompt (for details, refer to the [Create](#create-1) in Prompts), and it will set the context and tone for the whole conversation.

![](./img/system_prompt.png)

<!-- ##### Example

Let's compare a conversation with a system prompt selected and a conversation without a system prompt. For illustration purposes, we are going to use the compare mode (refer to the [Compare](#compare) section for details) and create two conversations with identical settings except for the system prompt selection.

The prompt used as a system prompt is as follows:

> Let's play a game. Name a city that starts with the last letter of the one that I named in a previous message and then tell me that it is my turn to name a city.

![](./img/System_prompt_example_compare_settings.png)

![](./img/System_prompt_example_conversation.png)

| **User message** | **Language model response without a system prompt** | **Language model response with a system prompt** |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grodno | Grodno, also known as Hrodna, is a city in western Belarus, near the borders with Poland and Lithuania. It is the administrative center of Grodno region and has a population of around 365,000 people. Grodno is one of the oldest cities in Belarus, dating back to the 11th century. The city boasts a rich history and diverse architectural styles, including baroque, classicism, and modernism. | Oslo. It's your turn!|
| Osaka | Osaka is a large port city and commercial center on the Japanese island of Honshu. It's known for its modern architecture, nightlife, and hearty street food. One of Osaka's most popular tourist destinations is the bustling urban area of Dotonbori, where the city's entertainment and dining scenes come to life with numerous restaurants, bars, and shops. | Ankara. Now it's your turn to name a city! |
| Antwerp | Antwerp is a city in Belgium, and it's the country’s biggest port. It is located on the River Scheldt, linked to the North Sea by the Westerschelde estuary. Known for its many historical buildings, squares, museums, and cultural attractions, it's a popular tourist destination. | Prague. Your turn to name a city! | -->

#### Temperature

The temperature parameter controls the creativity and randomness of the model's output. A higher temperature (e.g., 1.0) makes the output more diverse and creative, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.1) makes the output more focused and deterministic.

![](./img/temperature.png)

Adjusting the temperature allows you to balance creativity and consistency in the generated response.
 
#### Addons

You may want LLM to access particular data or technology to generate responses. This could be your company's database, a collection of PDF documents, calculation engines, API or any other data source or technology. You can accomplish this by using addons that allow AI models to tap into and use various data sources or technologies to produce responses.

In the AI DIAL framework, an **Addon** refers to a service or component that conforms to the Open API specification. Examples of Addon implementations include semantic search, Q&A search, database query generators, or any custom logic tailored to meet specific business requirements. You can add and use custom Addons to achieve a desired system behavior.

##### To select addons

In the **Conversation settings** window for the selected model, click **See all addons...** to view all available addons. You can select one or more addons and then click **Apply addons** to start using them.

![](./img/addons2.png)

### Actions

Click a **...** icon to open a conversation menu. There, you can view a list of all possible actions for the chosen conversation.

![](./img/conversation-menu.png)

> **Note**, that the available actions can vary depending on the selected conversation. For example, the Unpublish action will not be available if the conversation hasn't been published yet.

This is the list of all the supported actions:

- [Select](#select-to-delete): use to select conversations you want to delete.
- [Rename](#rename) - use to rename a conversation.
- [Compare](#compare): use to compare conversations with different settings.
- [Duplicate](#duplicate): use to duplicate a shared conversation.
- [Replay](#replay): use to reproduce conversations but with different settings.
- [Playback](#playback): use to simulate the current conversation without any engagement with models.
- [Export](#export): use to export a conversation.
- [Move to](#arrange): use to relocate conversations.
- [Share](#share): use to share a conversation by providing a link.
- [Unshare](#unshare): use to revoke a shred conversation.
- [Publish](#publish): use to publish conversations.
- [Unpublish](#unpublish): use to revoke public access from published conversations.
- [Info](#info): use to view metadata of a selected conversation.
- [Delete](#delete): use to delete a single conversation.

![](./img/conv-menu.png)

### Arrange

You can organize your conversations into folders. To create a new folder, simply click on the folder icon located in the bottom menu:

![](./img/create-new-folder.png)

You can also create a new folder or move a conversation to the existing folder from the **Move to** context menu of the selected conversation. New folders will automatically be arranged in the **Pinned conversations** tab in the Conversations panel.

![](./img/pinned-conversations.png)

##### Hierarchy

You can create a hierarchy of folders with three nesting levels. Just create a folder and drag-n-drop it in the other folder to create a nesting level. The same way, you can either drag-n-drop a conversation into a folder or use **Move to** in the context menu of a conversation to move it to a **parent** folder.

> **Note**: empty folders are deleted after refreshing the page.

##### Naming conventions

The following symbols in the folders names are prohibited: tab, `"`, `:`, `;`, `/`, `\`, `,`, `=`, `{`, `}`, `%`, `&` and will be excluded. Note that you can use the `.` symbol at the start or inside a name, but the dot at the end will be automatically removed.

The MAX length of the folder name is limited to 160 symbols. Everything beyond is cut off. 

### Search and Filter

Use the **Search** box to search conversations by their names. If you have any shared conversations, you can apply **Shared by me** filter to sort them out.

![](./img/search-conv.png)

### Create

There are several ways to initiate a dialog with a [conversational agent](#conversational-agents): 

* To communicate with the current conversational agent (by default, the last one used by the user), simply begin typing in the text box located in the chat area.
* In My Workspace or Marketplace, select an agent and click **Use ...** button to initiate a conversation. Refer to [Converse](#converse) to learn more.
* On the main chat screen, click the **Plus** icon to select agent and start a conversation.

![](./img/start-conv.png)

**Please be aware** that new conversations will show up in the conversations panel located to the left of the main chat area. However, if you start a conversation and close it while it is still empty, it will neither be displayed on the panel nor saved in your conversations.

### Rename

When you create a new conversation, it is automatically named after the first line in your first prompt. For instance, if your prompt consists of several sentences divided by a tab, the first sentence will be used as the conversation's name. Moreover, the MAX length of the conversation name is limited to 160 symbols. Everything beyond is cut off. After a conversation is created, you can rename it.

##### To rename a conversation

1. Click **Rename** in the context menu of the selected conversation.
2. Enter a new name and submit.

![](./img/rename-conversation.png)

##### Naming conventions

The following symbols in the conversation names are prohibited: tab, `"`, `:`, `;`, `/`, `\`, `,`, `=`, `{`, `}`, `%`, `&` and will be excluded. Note that you can use the `.` symbol at the start or inside a name, but the dot at the end will be automatically removed.

### Share

You can share a conversation or a folder with several conversations with other users. Yo can also receive a shared conversation.

> Watch [Collaboration](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/3.dial-collaboration.md) demo video to learn more about sharing and other collaboration features in AI DIAL.

##### To receive a shared conversation

If a conversation has been shared with you, it can be located in the **Shared with me** section in the left panel.

![](./img/shared-with-me.png)

> **Important**: you cannot change a conversation that has been shared with you. To be able to work with it, [duplicate it](#duplicate).

##### To share a conversation

> **Note**: You can share entire folders with conversations. When you share a folder, all folders and conversations in it will be shared as well.

If you want to share a conversation or a folder, click on **Share** in the contextual menu and send the link to the intended recipient.

![](./img/share_conv.png)

After the recipient has opened your link, the arrow icon appears near its name. **Note**, it may be required to reload the page to update the status of the shared conversation.

![](./img/shared.png)

To filter and view only the conversations that you have shared, click on the **Shared by me** checkbox in the filter:

![](./img/shared-by-me.png)


### Unshare

To revoke access from all users you have shared with, click **Unshare** in the contextual menu and then confirm action in the dialog window.

![](./img/unshare_conv.png)

### Duplicate

Duplicate a shared with you conversation to be able to change it. To duplicate a conversation, click **Duplicate** in the contextual menu.

> This feature is available only for conversations shared with you. 

![](./img/duplicate_conv.png)

### Export

You can export conversations. If a conversation includes attachments, you can export it with or without attachments. 

You can also export all your conversations at once without attachments in a JSON format.

> Exported conversations are named by the following pattern: prefix "epam_ai_dial_chat", then "with_attachments" if the conversation was exported with attachments, then "month_day". However, the naming convention is configurable in the chat config.

##### Export a single conversation with attachments

1. On the left panel, in the conversation contextual menu, point to **Export**.
2. Click **With attachments**. 

The conversation will be exported as a **ZIP** archive. Please note that the name of the ZIP archive follows the format `file_name.dial`. You can manage it just like a normal ZIP archive.

![](./img/export-with-att.png)

##### Export a single conversation without attachments

1. On the left panel, in the conversation contextual menu, point to **Export**.
2. Click **Without attachments**. 

The conversation will be exported as a **JSON** file.

![](./img/export-without-att.png)

##### Export all conversations

To export all conversations, at the bottom of the left panel, click the **Export conversations** icon.

> Conversations will be exported without attachments.

![](./img/export_all.png)

### Import

Exported conversations can be imported. 

To import a JSON file with a conversation or a ZIP archive with several conversations (may include attachments as well), click the **Import conversations** icon at the bottom of the left panel and then select a file with conversations.

![](./img/import_conv.png)

When you import a conversation with attachments, the attachments will be available in the parent of the root folder in the [Attachments Manager](#attachments-manager).

When importing a **duplicate** of an existing conversation, you will be prompted to select one of the proceeding options for both the conversation and each of the attachments: 

* Replace - replace the original conversation/attachment 
* Ignore - do nothing
* Postfix - add a postfix to the imported conversation/attachment. For example: *my-conversation 1* , where 1 is added postfix to the name of the duplicated imported conversation.

![](./img/import-export.png)

### Info

Click **Info** in the conversation menu to view the conversation metadata: the date it was updated and the creation date.

![](./img/conv-info.png)

### Delete

You can delete a single conversation, selected conversations or all conversations.

* To delete a **single** conversation, on the left panel, in the conversation contextual menu, select **Delete** and confirm your action.
* To delete **all** conversations, at the bottom of the left panel, click the **Delete all conversations** icon.

![](./img/delete-conversation.png)

### Select to Delete

Also, you can use a *selection* mode to choose conversation(s) you want to delete:

* Click **Select all** button in the bottom panel. When you do this, all conversations get preselected and you can unselect the ones you want to **keep**. You can also click **Unselect all** in the bottom panel to clear the selection.

![](./img/select-chat1.png)

* Click **Select** in the conversation menu to enter into a *selection* mode. In this mode, you can hover over any conversation and use checkboxes to select/unselect conversations you want to delete. You can also click **Unselect all** in the bottom panel to clear the selection.

![](./img/select-chat2.png)

### Replay

You can use **Replay** to reproduce conversations but with different settings (e.g. a different model). A replayed conversation can be used to compare responses to the same questions from different models and with different settings of the conversation. 

![](./img/replay-conversation.png)
 
Use **Replay as is** to reproduce the conversation with the original settings. You can find Replay as is if you click **Change agent** or an agent icon in the conversation header menu.

![](./img/Replay_as_is.png) 

##### To replay a conversation

1.	Click **Replay** in the conversation menu. 
2.	Click **Start replay**.
3.	In the process of replaying, you can stop and resume the replay process using controls in the text box **Stop generating** and **Continue replay** respectively.

![](./img/continue-replay.png) 

The replayed conversation is displayed as a new conversation with the `[Replay]` tag in the list of your conversations. 

![](./img/replay1.png) 

### Parameterized Replay

You can use Parameterized Replay to create your own chats or stories with custom variables and share them with your team. Such parametrized conversations others can follow, but with their own details or answers to create a personalized experience. This makes chat a much more useful tool for sharing information and collaboration.

##### Prompt-based

You can create a parametrized conversation using a special prompt with variables.

Let's create a simple Travel Guide conversation, which will take a user though several steps to clarify information and provide the answer.

1. Start by [creating a special prompt](#create-1) with [variables](#variables). Use templates (this `{{VariableName|DefaultValue}}` or this `{{VariableName}}`) to add variables into your prompt with or without default values. For example: `I'd like to travel to {{country|Japan}}. Could you please suggest {{num-attractions|10}} of the best attractions? I will be there for {{num-days}}. Thank you.`
2. To use your parametrized prompt, type `/` in the conversation text input area and select your prompt. You will be asked to provide your inputs for variables in a pop-up window. Enter your inputs and click `Submit`. The prompt is now populated with your inputs in the conversation text box. Send message to start.
3. The chat will return its response to your prompt.
4. You can now click [Replay](#replay) in your conversation's menu to repeat this dialogue but with different input parameters.
5. You can [Share](#share) this conversation with someone. When a person opens the shared conversation, they will be prompted to fill in their personal input in the parameterized prompt, allowing them to have the same conversation but with their custom inputs, for example, travel to USA instead of Japan.

##### Dynamic

You can create a parametrized conversation from any message in your chat. This scenario does not require having any pre-configured prompts.

> Watch a [demo video](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/5.dial-parameterized-replay.md) to see it in action.

1. Within a conversation, you can set any message as a template for subsequent replay. Use **Set message template** to invoke the **Message template** window.

   ![](./img/param-replay-icon.png)

2. In the **Message template** window, you can substitute sections of your original message with [variables](#variables) under the **Set template** tab. To achieve this, copy a segment from your original message and paste it into the first input box. Then, in the second input box, introduce a variable using the format: `{{Variable name}}`. For instance, in our example, we have replaced "France" with the `{{Country}}` variable.

   ![](./img/param-replay-form.png)

   In the **Preview** tab, you can preview your original message with variables:

   ![](./img/param-replay-form-preview.png)

3. Once you click save, you can return to your conversation. In the conversation menu, select [Replay](#replay) to initiate the replay of this conversation. The chat will prompt you to input values for your variable(s) to replay the conversation. You have the option to replay it as it originally was (using the same model as in your initial conversation) - select **Replay as is** (you can find it if you click **Change agent**), or you can alter the settings of the conversation to experiment with different models and parameters.
4. You can [Share](#share) this conversation with others. When someone opens the shared conversation, they will be prompted to provide their own inputs in the template. This allows experiencing the same conversation but with personalized inputs, such as traveling to the USA instead of France.

### Playback

The Playback mode can be used to simulate the current conversation without any engagement with models. This mode accurately reproduces the conversation like a recording. **Note**, that this differs from the Replay mode, where the prompts are resubmitted to the chosen model and the outcomes may differ from the initial conversation.

![](./img/playback-conversation.png)

During playback, you have the ability to rewind, fast forward, or halt the process.

![](./img/playback-controls.png)

### Compare

Use the Compare mode to compare two new (or two existing) conversations with different setting (e.g. different models or temperature).

##### To compare two NEW conversations

1.	Click the **Compare** icon in the menu at the bottom of the left panel.
2.	Define settings for both conversations. To do that, click **Configure settings** for any conversation to open a dialog window.
3.	Type your question (prompt) in the chat box to begin.

![](./img/compare-3.png)

Once you initiate a conversation in this mode, the system creates two new conversations with the same name but adds numbers to them. If you have chosen different language models, the conversations icons will differ accordingly.

![](./img/compare-4.png)

##### To compare two EXISTING conversations

> **Important**: this Compare mode works only with conversations with the same amount of prompts from a user. The application will not allow comparing two conversations with different amounts of prompts.

1.	On the left panel, in the conversation menu of a conversation, select **Compare**.
2.	In the main section, under **Select conversation to compare with**, select the second conversation from the drop box. 
3. By default, only conversations with the same name are available in the drop box. Select **Show all conversations** to see the full list of conversations.
4.	Type your question (prompt) in the chat box.

![](./img/compare.png)

### Publish

You can publish conversations to make them available for the target audience.

> Watch [Publications](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/4.dial-publications.md) demo video to learn more about collaboration features in AI DIAL.

> **Note**: to publish a shared conversation, [duplicate](#duplicate) it and then publish. 

##### To publish a conversation

1. Click **Publish** in the conversation menu. 

![](./img/publish-conversation.png)

2. In the pop-up window:
   * Enter **publication request name** in the upper area.
   * In **Publish to**, you can select the target destination. You can also create a dedicated folder to publish your conversation into.
   * In **Allow access..**, specify access rules and the target audience. For example Role-Equals-Admin. **Note**: the available roles are configured for each organization individually. Contact your support to find out the rules are applicable in your organization.
   * In **Conversations**, you can choose what conversations you want to publish (if you have selected a folder with several conversations). If conversations include attachments, you can also select them in the **Files** section.
   * Assign a version to your request. 
   * Click **Send request** to send your publish request to the administrator.
   ![](./img/publish-request.png)

3. When your request is approved, the published conversation or a folder with conversation(s) will become available in the Organization tab.

![](./img/organization-section.png)

##### Versioning

When you make a publication request, it is required to assign it a unique version number. A version must follow format: `0.0.0`. With each request you must provide a new version - the system will not accept two identical versions. 

Versioning helps you create specific publications for different groups of people, run experiments, and keep track of your conversations easily.

You can add a **version** of your publication request next to the conversation check box:

![](./img/versioning1.png)

If you try to publish this conversation again, you will be able to view the last version or a drop-down with versions:

![](./img/versioning2.png)

When you open a published conversation, you can view and switch between its versions in the [conversation settings](#conversation-settings): 

![](./img/versioning3.png)

### Unpublish

You can unpublish conversations to withdraw them from public use.

##### To unpublish a conversation

1. Click **Unpublish** in the conversation menu. 

   ![](./img/unpublish-conversation.png)

2. In the pop-up window:
   * Enter **unpublish request name** in the upper area.
   * In **Conversations**, if you have selected a folder, you can choose what conversations you want to unpublish. If conversation(s) include attachment(s), you can also select them in the **Files** section.
   * Click **Send request** to send your unpublish request to the administrator.
  
   ![](./img/unpublish-request.png)

3. When your request is approved by the administrator, the unpublished conversation or a folder with conversation(s) will become unavailable in the Organization tab.
   
## Prompts

A prompt is an instruction, a question, or a message that a user provides to a language model to receive an answer. Prompts can also contain constraints or requirements. They help the model understand the task at hand and the types of responses that are expected. 
You can use prompts as templates for your messages, instructions to the model, or to encourage the model to generate specific types of content. 
In AI DIAL, you can create prompts beforehand and reuse them in one or several conversations.

Prompts can be applied to one message or a whole conversation. Refer to the [System prompt](#system-prompt) section of this guide for details.

The section with your prompts is located in the right-hand area of the screen. In this section, you can work with saved prompts: create new templates, update them, and organize them with folders. 

> All your prompts are stored on the server, and you can access them from any device you use.

### Actions

Click a **...** icon to open a prompt menu. There, you can find a list of all the available actions for the selected prompt.

![](./img/prompt-menu.png)

This is the list of all the supported actions. Please note that the available actions can differ depending on the selected prompt. For instance, the Unpublish action won't be available if the prompt hasn't been published yet.

- [Use](#use): click to use the selected prompt.
- [Select](#select-to-delete-1): use to select prompts you want to delete.
- [Edit](#create-1): use to edit prompts.

You can organize your prompts in folders. To create a new folder, click on the folder icon in the bottom menu:

![](./img/create-new-folder-prompt.png)

You can also create a new folder or move a prompt to the existing folder from the **Move to** context menu of the selected prompt: 

![](./img/move_prompt.png)

New folders will automatically be arranged in the **Pinned prompts** tab in the Prompts panel.

![](./img/pinned-prompts.png)

##### Hierarchy

You can create a hierarchy of folders with three nesting levels. Just create a folder and drag-n-drop it in the other folder to create a nesting level. The same way, you can either drag-n-drop a prompt into a folder or use **Move to** in the context menu of a prompt to move it to a **parent** folder.

> **Note**: empty folders are deleted after refreshing the page.

##### Naming conventions

The following symbols in the folders names are prohibited: tab, `"`, `:`, `;`, `/`, `\`, `,`, `=`, `{`, `}`, `%`, `&` and will be excluded. Note that you can use the `.` symbol at the start or inside a name, but the dot at the end will be automatically removed.

The MAX length of the folder name is limited to 160 symbols. Everything beyond is cut off. 

### Search and Filter

Use the **Search** box to search prompts by their names. If you have any shared prompts, you can apply **Shared by me** filter to sort them out.

![](./img/pt_search.png)

### Use

### Create

##### To create a new prompt

1.	On the right panel, select **New prompt**.
2.	Fill in the **Name**, **Description**, and **Prompt** boxes. The following symbols in the prompt names are prohibited: tab, `:`, `;`, `/`, `\`, `,`, `=`, `{`, `}`, `%`, `&`. Note that you can use the `.` symbol at the start or inside a name, but the dot at the end will be automatically removed. The MAX length of the prompt name is limited to 160 symbols. Everything beyond is cut off.
3.	Click **Save**.

> While both the **Name** and **Description** fields are required to create a prompt, they do not serve as instructions for the language model. They simply help you differentiate this prompt from others. The language model will only utilize instructions from the **Prompt** box.

![](./img/create-pt.png)

#### Variables

You can use prompts as templates for your instructions to a language model. You can also add variables in your prompts. Use notation such as `{{variableName}}` or `{{variableName|Default Value}}` to add variables.

> Refer to [Parameterized Replay](#parameterized-replay) to view a use case when prompts are used to create parametrized conversations.

For example, you need to calculate an equation `a + b/c`, round up the answer, and then divide it by 4.
 
Create the following prompt: 

`{{a}}+{{b}}/{{c}}=`

Round up the answer to three digits and divide by four

![](./img/math-prompt1.png)

Here, `a`, `b`, and `c` are variables. In the prompt body, they are denoted by double curly brackets: `{{ }}`.

> You can combine mathematical expressions and natural language in your prompts.

After you have created the prompt, you can use it by typing a slash `/` in the chat box and selecting the name of a prompt (it is **Math** in our example). You’ll see the following form where you can enter any numbers:

![](./img/math-prompt.png)

When you submit the form, your message will look like on the illustration below:
  
![](./img/math-prompt3.png)

Generally, variables can be anything, not only numbers. For example, you can create a prompt with the following body: `Who played {{character}} in {{movie}}? or What is a Latin name of {{plant common name}}?`

### Info

Click **Info** in the prompt menu to view the prompt metadata: the date it was updated and the creation date.

3. When your request is approved by the administrator, the unpublished prompt or a folder with prompt(s) will become unavailable in the Organization tab.

## Chat 

The chat occupies the central part of the main screen, allowing you to input messages, see replies, and execute various supported tasks based on the application and chat settings.

![](./img/chat.png)

### Actions

**During a conversation**, you can perform various actions:

**Entering messages**: you can use a text box at the bottom to enter your prompts and trigger the generation of answers by hitting **Enter** on your keyboard or clicking the **Send** button in the text box.

![](./img/caht-box.png)

You can enter a prompt manually or select one of [existing prompts](#prompts). 

Enter `/` in the chat text box to select one of the available prompts. You can also click [Use](#use) in the prompt's menu to populate it in the text box.

**Copying responses**: you can copy answers to reuse them some place else.

![](./img/copy-answer.png)

**Stop and Regenerate**: in the process of generating the response, you can stop it by clicking a **Stop** icon in the text box.

![](./img/stop-generating.png)

When the response generation has been stopped, you can regenerate it. **Important**: If you encounter a server error or click the **Stop Generating** button and receive an empty response, the **Send** button will be disabled. To continue the conversation, you'll need to generate the answer again. If you receive a partial response (a combination of text and an error), the model can still proceed, while for Assistants/Applications, you'll need to generate the response again.

![](./img/regenerate.png)

**Working with prompts**: during the conversation, you can edit or delete your prompts. After a prompt has been edited, the response is regenerated, and all your prompts after the edited one will be deleted. When you delete your prompt, the response will be deleted, too.

**Working with attachments in responses**: if in the response you have received an attachment, you can click the **Download** icon near the file name to download it or an **Expand** to preview:

![](./img/download-file.png)

**Attach files to requests**: some models and applications (e.g. _DIAL RAG_) support adding attachments (files, links, folders) to conversations. In this case, you'll see the **Attachments** icon available in the chat box. Click it to upload a file from your device or select an already uploaded file. Refer to the [Manage attachments](#attachments) section for details.

![](./img/attach.png)

**Like/Dislike**: you can like and dislike responses in a conversation. Use likes to highlight important responses and dislikes to mark the responses you don't need. 

![](./img/like.png)

**View and change current settings**: on the top bar you can view and manage agent and conversation settings. Refer to [Conversation Settings](#conversation-settings) to learn more.

![](./img/chat-settings-bar.png)

### Isolated View Mode

In the Isolated View Mode, you can access the AI DIAL Chat in a simplified view mode with the predefined conversational agent. To access this mode, follow a specific URL `https://server/models/modelID` or `https://server/models/applicationID`. Conversation and prompt panels are not shown in this mode. All conversations that are created in this mode, will also be displayed in the standard chat view mode.

For instance, to open chat with GPT-4 model, go to `https://AI DIAL Chat URL/models/gpt-4` and access a streamlined user interface that only contains a chat input with GPT-4:

### Flow

This is the high level overview of the publication workflow: 

1. Chat user sends a publication request for the selected resource(s) ([conversation](#publish), [prompt](#publish-1), [application](#publish-app)).
2. Admin receives the publication request, reviews it and either approves or declines. Refer to [Process Publish Requests](#process-publish-requests) to learn more.
3. In case the publication request has been approved, the published resources (conversations and prompts) become available for the target audience in the Organization section in the chat application. Published applications can be found in [DIAL Marketplace](#dial-marketplace). If the published conversation includes attachments, they will be available in the [Attachments Manager](#attachments-manager).
4. Resource owner can unpublish the published resource.

> Refer to [Conversations](#publish), [Prompts](#publish-1) and [Publish App](#publish-app) to view step-by-step instructions.

## Administrators

Administrators are chat users that can perform additional actions. Chat interface for administrators includes extra components (for example the **Approve required** tab in conversations and prompts sections)

### Process Publish Requests

Users with the admin role have access to the **Approve required** tab in conversations and prompts sections, where they can view all publish and unpublish requests from users. 

> **Note**, publication requests for applications appear in the Prompts section.

![](./img/admin-panel.png)

The counter shows the number of requests to be reviewed. Each such request has a color dot attached to it. The refresh of a browser updates this information.

![](./img/review3.png)

**To review**:

1. Click on any conversation or prompt request to open the review window. 
2. In the review window, you can preview the details of the request and download attached files, if present. **Note**, that a request can include both publish and unpublish requests. The latter is highlighted in red color in the list of conversations or prompts. Such mixed requests can be currently realized exclusively using DIAL API. 
3. If **Go to a review...** is displayed, click it to review conversation(s) or prompt(s) in the request. For the unfinished review, this button changes to **Continue review...**. **Note**, you cannot approve the request which has not been reviewed in full. 

![](./img/review-mode.png)

4. In the review mode, you can use arrows to navigate between conversations/prompts and click **Back to publication request** when finished reviewing.

![](./img/review-mode2.png)

AI DIAL Chat enables data visualization for specific data types using data visualizers. It comes with built-in support for the [Plotly data visualizer](#plotly). To link any other custom visualizers, you can use the [DIAL Chat Visualizer Connector](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-chat/blob/development/libs/chat-visualizer-connector/README.md) library.

> Refer to [Data Visualization](/docs/platform/4.chat/2.data-visualization-intro.md) to learn more about visualizing data in chat and custom visualization apps.

### Plotly

Plotly is an open-source JavaScript library that enables the creation of diverse data visualizations, including charts, 3D graphs, and more.

![](./img/plotly.png)

> * Refer to [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) to learn more. 
> * Watch [Animated Scatterplot](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/6.animated-scatterplot.md) demo video to see how statistical data can be visualized in AI DIAL Chat using a Plotly animated scatterplot.
> * Watch [Omics AI Assistant](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/7.dial-omics-assistant.md) demo video to see how protein structures can be visualized with Plotly.

AI DIAL Chat integrates with Plotly, offering robust data visualization capabilities. To utilize Plotly, choose an AI DIAL application that supports this feature. These applications must be capable of querying data (either from a URL or directly from the Chat application) based on user input and returning it in a format compatible with Plotly. Chat automatically detects attachments in this format and uses Plotly to visualize the data.

![](./img/plotly2.png)

The visualizations come with standard Plotly controls for easy manipulation.

> Refer to [Plotly GitHub](https://github.com/plotly/react-plotly.js) to learn more. 

## Conversational Agents

In AI DIAL Chat, you can have a dialog with several types of conversational agents: language models, applications and assistants.

### Language Models

##### Available Models

In the [DIAL Marketplace](#dial-marketplace) section, you can view all the models available on your AI DIAL environment. There, you can select models to add them to [My workspace](#my-workspace).

> Refer to [Supported Models](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md) to view all the models supported in AI DIAL.

![](./img/marketplace-home-select.png)

### Applications

> Refer to [My workspace](#my-workspace) to learn how to add and manage applications in AI DIAL Chat.

In AI DIAL, an “application” is any programming logic that conforms to the [Unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) of AI DIAL or registered custom endpoints and packaged as a ready-to-deploy solution.

AI DIAL Chat users can engage with applications via standard or fully customized interfaces. Applications can interact via the Unified API, or registered custom endpoints, enabling creation of complex scenarios and utilizing all AI DIAL features.

You can expand the platform by introducing custom application types to build the applications you need, using the DIAL SDK to streamline the development process.

> Refer to [Extensibility](https://epam-rail.com/extension-framework) to learn more.

AI DIAL platform serves as an **application server**, offering tools to develop, deploy and operate custom applications. Refer to [Application Types](#standard-application-types) to learn more about DIAL applications.

> Refer to [AI DIAL Application Server](https://epam-rail.com/app-server) to learn more.

Applications can be developed (using [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk)) to execute any custom logic and can even form an [ecosystem](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/2.architecture.md#full-platform-landscape) and interact with each other through the [Unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) with access to all DIAL Core features among which is connectivity to models (including multi-modal models), file storage, access control, per-request API keys and other.

> Watch a [DIAL RAG](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/1.dial-rag.md) and [DIAL ChatHub](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/3.dial-chathub.md) videos as examples of what DIAL applications may look like.

In the [DIAL Marketplace](#dial-marketplace) section, you can view all the applications available on your DIAL environment. There, you can select applications to add them to [My workspace](#my-workspace).

##### To talk to an application

1. In the [DIAL Marketplace](#dial-marketplace) section, you can view all the applications available on your DIAL environment. There, you can select applications to add them to [My workspace](#my-workspace).
2. To display applications, select just **Applications** in **Types**.
3. Click any of the available applications in Marketplace or My workspace, click **Use application** to navigate back to the main screen with this application pre-selected for conversation.

> Refer to [Agents](#agents) to learn how to change conversational agents prior or during a conversation. 

![](./img/marketplace-app-select.png)

### Standard Application Types

Application types serve as templates for building customized versions of applications. AI DIAL offers various standard application types accessible from [My workspace](#my-workspace), allowing you to create new applications based on these templates.

> Refer to [Extensibility](https://epam-rail.com/extension-framework) to learn more.

AI DIAL has a flexible architecture that supports adding custom application types, enabling implementations that go beyond the standard application types and even implementing a fully custom UI replacing the standard chat interface.

#### Custom Apps

DIAL applications can be integrated into the DIAL Core deployment. By doing so, these applications will be immediately available in your chat from the start. For examples, refer to the [dynamic setting](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-settings) in DIAL Core. Additionally, you can register your custom and deployed applications through the [DIAL API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Applications/paths/~1v1~1applications~1%7BBucket%7D~1%7BApplication%20Path%7D/put) and [DIAL Marketplace](#add-custom-app). In such cases, the configuration of your custom applications, described in a JSON file, is saved in your blob store and accessed by DIAL Core for usage.

> * Refer to [My workspace](#add-custom-app) to learn how to add a custom app.
> * Refer to [Custom Apps Deployment](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/0.deployment/0.custom_apps_deployment.md) to learn how to deploy custom applications using Helm chat and configure DIAL Core.

#### Quick Apps

DIAL Quick Apps are conceptually similar to OpenAI's GPT. Quick Apps do not contain any programming code (they include a toolset, description and instruction to the language model) and enable you to rapidly build an application right within DIAL Chat, use it, and share it with others. Quick Apps can be used to simplify a workflow or carry out a specific task. For example, you can create a Quick App with a configuration allowing it to call an external API to get a real-time weather forecast for a specific location.

> * Watch a [Demo Video](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/5.quick-apps.md) with an introduction to Quick Apps.
> * Refer to [My workspace](#add-quick-app) to learn how to add Quick Apps.

#### Code Apps

DIAL Core Apps allow you to develop, deploy and run your Python applications directly in the AI DIAL Chat. It is a useful tool if you need to quickly create an application for the POC, deploy it and share with the selected audience.  

> * Watch a [Demo Video](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/4.code-apps.md) with an introduction to Code Apps.
> * Refer to [My workspace](#add-code-app) to learn how to add Code Apps.

#### Mindmaps

Mindmap enables users to access information through an interactive knowledge graph and natural language. The application pulls data from various sources, including documents, URLs, and other data inputs and then presents it on UI as a interactive knowledge graph, facilitating intuitive and engaging user interactions with information.

> Watch [demo video](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/mindmap-studio.md) to see the AI DIAL Mindmap Studio in action.


### Assistants

In the AI DIAL, assistant is a combination of a preselected [addon](#addons) and a [system prompt](#system-prompt) that enable specific behavior of a language model, allowing to achieve responses adjusted to user needs. Unlike the model+addon configuration, where users have the flexibility to choose different addons, assistants come with predetermined addons that cannot be removed or unselected. However, the model can still be reassigned within the assistant.

Assistants give you more control over LLM behavior, resulting in tailored and accurate responses that match specific needs. The flexibility of this combination lets you create custom assistants. These assistants can range from simple tasks, like asking the LLM to provide answers in a specific tone or style (e.g., like a pirate), to more complex tasks, such as restricting the LLM's data to a specific geographical area (e.g., providing weather forecasts for Chicago only). Combining addons and system prompts enables better customization and adaptability to various situations, leading to more versatile responses.

In the [DIAL Marketplace](#dial-marketplace) section, you can view all the assistants available on your DIAL environment. There, you can select assistants to add them to [My workspace](#my-workspace).

##### To talk to an assistant

1. In the [DIAL Marketplace](#dial-marketplace) section, you can view all the assistants available on your DIAL environment. There, you can select assistants to add them to [My workspace](#my-workspace).
2. To display assistants, select just **Assistants** in **Types**.
3. Click any of the available assistants in Marketplace or My workspace, click **Use assistant** to navigate back to the main screen with this assistant pre-selected for conversation.

* [DIAL Marketplace](#dial-marketplace): the main screen of DIAL Marketplace which includes all conversational agents available on your DIAL environment.
* [My workspace](#my-workspace): this screen includes all conversational agents that you have selected in DIAL Marketplace. In this section, you can also add and manage your custom applications.

![](./img/dial-marketplace2.png)

From both marketplace and workspace you can click **Back to Chat** to navigate to the main chat screen.

![](./img/dial-marketplace3.png)

##### Filters & Views

* Use the **Type** filters to display any or all [conversational agents](#conversational-agents). **Note**, that all agents are displayed by default - use the Type filter to narrow down the scope of the displayed agents. 
* A conversational agent can be associated with a specific topic describing the area of its application. Use the **Topics** filter to refine the output by specific topics. 
* Use the **Source** filter to apply additional filtering criteria related to the source of conversational agents (e.g. you can filter just the apps shared with you).
* The **Search** allows you to swiftly locate any item by its name.
* Use view toggle to switch between the table and the card view.

### DIAL Marketplace

Click **DIAL Marketplace** to navigate to the *home page* of DIAL Marketplace where you can find all [applications](#applications), [language models](#available-models) and [assistants](#assistants) available on your DIAL environment. Here, you can also find all applications [published](#publish-app) in your organization.

![](./img/dial-marketplace.png)

##### Add to My workspace

In the DIAL Marketplace main screen, you can view details of any conversational agent and add it to [My workspace](#my-workspace).

To simply add/remove an item to/from My workspace, click **Add/Remove to/from My workspace** label:

![](./img/add-to-workspace.png)

You can also add a conversational agent to My workspace by initiating a conversation with it. For example, to add a model:

1. In the [DIAL Marketplace](#dial-marketplace) section, you can view all the models available on your DIAL environment. There, you can select models to add them to [My workspace](#my-workspace).
2. To display models, select just **Models** in **Types**.
3. To select a model, click any of the available models in Marketplace or My workspace, click **Use model** to navigate back to the main screen with this model pre-selected for conversation.

> Refer to [Agents](#agents) to learn how to change conversational agents prior or during a conversation. 

![](./img/marketplace-home-select.png)

> **Please note**, that if you start a conversation and then remove the associated item from My workspace, you will need to reinstate the item to continue the conversation. A button will appear in place of the chat text box. Simply click this button to return the item to My workspace and resume the conversation.

![](./img/add-to-continue.png)

### My workspace

In **My workspace**, you can access and manage all conversational agents that you have added in [DIAL Marketplace](#dial-marketplace). Here, you can view and manage your agents. 

#### Application Builder

In My workspace, you can use Application Builder to create applications of available [Application Types](#standard-application-types). It is a useful feature, allowing users with different technical backgrounds to quickly build prototypes and applications in a no-code fashion.

![](./img/app-builder.png)

Application Builder interface enables configuration and deployment of applications, which can vary depending on the type of application. This interface allows you to not only set up and launch applications but also test them before going live.

##### Custom UI

The standard AI DIAL Chat UI is designed to meet the needs of typical conversational applications. However, to accommodate the requirements of applications that exceed the standard chat UI functionality, new application types can be introduced to implement a fully custom UI (even not chat-like UI), which can completely replace the standard chat interface during interactions with a specific application.

> You can define custom UI for application builder and for your application in JSON schema when registering a new application type.

![](./img/mindmap.png)

> * Refer to [Extensibility](https://epam-rail.com/extension-framework) to learn more.
> * Watch [demo video](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/mindmap-studio.md) to see the Mindmap Studio in action.

#### Add Custom App

> You can also add custom applications using [DIAL API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Applications/paths/~1v1~1applications~1%7BBucket%7D~1%7BApplication%20Path%7D/put).

If you want to add your custom application, you can do it in AI DIAL Application Builder or via [DIAL API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api). After adding a custom application, a JSON file describing the configuration of your application will be saved in a dedicated folder within a blob store account bucket assigned to your user account. These files can then be accessed by DIAL Core to facilitate the integration and operation of your applications. Configuration of a custom application matches DIAL Core dynamic configuration for applications. Refer to [Examples](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core/blob/development/sample/aidial.config.json) to view how it can look like.

> **Important Requirement**: Custom applications must provide a chat completion endpoint for DIAL Core and adhere to the [Unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#/paths/~1openai~1deployments~1%7BDeployment%20Name%7D~1chat~1completions/post) standards to ensure seamless integration and functionality.

##### To Add Custom App

1. In My workspace, click **Add app** and select **Custom App** to launch Application Builder.
2. Follow the steps to configure application. Refer to [Add application](#addedit-application-form) form to see the description of parameters.
3. When you configure all the required parameters, click **Save and exit**. Your new application will appear in [My workspace](#my-workspace).

2. Make changes and click **Save**

#### Share App

Applications (or their versions) can be shared with other users by sending a sharing link. In this section, you can learn about: 

* [Sharing](#to-share-app)
* [Unsharing](#to-unshare-app)
* [Removing access](#to-remove-access)
* [Editing rights](#sharing-with-editing-rights)

##### To share app

Use **Share** to grant other users rights to use your application. You can repeat the procedure described in this section more than once to share with different users.

> **Note**, that you can share only your own applications. You cannot share an application that has been shared with you.

1. In My workspace, in the application menu, click **Share**.

![](./img/share-app.png)

2. If necessary, you can select a specific version of the application you want to share.
2. In the pop-up dialog window, select whether you want to give editing rights with the sharing link. **Important**: if you grant editing rights to your app, make sure you are familiar with the [main principles](#sharing-with-editing-rights) outlined in this documentation.
3. Confirm the action in the dialog window.
4. Provide the sharing link to the target user with whom you want to share your app.

A shared application (or its version if only a specific version has been shared) is labeled with the blue arrow:

![](./img/share-app3.png)

##### Sharing with editing rights

The key distinction between sharing and [publishing](#publish-app) is that sharing allows you to grant not only the rights to use but also editing access to your application. 

**Important**: when an application (or its specific version) is shared, any updates made to the app become immediately available to the users with whom the application has been shared, but it's important to note that **conflict resolution** for simultaneous edits by multiple users is not supported, so the changes submitted first will be applied to the shared application for all users immediately.

Applications shared with and without editing rights have different scope of actions available for the target user: 

![](./img/share-app2.png)

##### To remove access

> **Note**: a shared application is revoked from the shared usage when the apps's name or version is modified by the application owner.

You can revoke access for all users with whom you have share the application.

1. Select the shared application for which you want to revoke access. You can identify the shared apps by the blue arrow pinned to the icon of the shared application. 
2. Click **Share** in the applications menu.
3. In the open dialog window, click **Remove access for all users** and confirm the unshare action in the pop-up window.
