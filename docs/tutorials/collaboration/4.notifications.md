# Notifications

How to create a notification?

Use [Notification](https://epam-rail.com/dial_api#tag/Notifications) and [Subscribe](https://epam-rail.com/dial_api#tag/Notifications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1notification~1delete/post) APIs to create and manage notifications for publication requests. 

> Note, that currently this functionality is available only via API. We are working on supporting it in AI DIAL Chat UI.

## Subscriptions

Use [Subscribe API](https://epam-rail.com/dial_api#tag/Notifications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1notification~1delete/post) to subscribe for changes (create, update, delete) made by other users to a specific resource.

What is the flow?
How can I receive notifications? Is it notifications api?

Flow: 

1. I subscribe
2. I get a list of notifications 
3. I delete a specific notification
