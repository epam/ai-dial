# Sharing

## Introduction

In AI DIAL, *resources* refers to conversations, prompts, files, and applications. When a resource is created or uploaded to DIAL, it is stored in a dedicated storage bucket. You have the ability to share these resources with other users or applications. This sharing functionality is available through both the DIAL API and the AI DIAL Chat UI.

## DIAL API

In the sharing process there are two sides: the resource owner and the resource recipient. AI DIAL API has endpoints to facilitate workflows for these two sides.

Endpoints for **resource owner**:

* `/create`: resource owners can use this endpoint to share a resource by creating an `invitationLink` which includes an `invitationId`. On top of that, you can grant **read** or **write** access to your resource. **Note**: If an app/user changes the shared resource, HTTP **etag** is used by AI DIAL Core to determine versioning and resolve conflicts. You can use [Subscription API](/tutorials/collaboration/notifications#subscriptions) to get notifications about changes made by other users or applications. Refer to [DIAL API](https://epam-rail.com/dial_api#tag/Sharing/paths/~1v1~1ops~1resource~1share~1create/post) to view examples. **Limitations**: the system does not support getting all the recipients of a shared resource.
* `/list`: use this endpoint to query all the resources that were shared by you. In the request body, provide `others` as `with` parameter value. Refer to [DIAL API](https://epam-rail.com/dial_api#tag/Sharing/paths/~1v1~1ops~1resource~1share~1list/post) to view examples. **Note**, that in case you share a conversation with attachments, attachments are shared as well, but they will appear in the response as a separate shared resources.
* `/revoke`: when you want to stop sharing a resource, use this endpoint to unshare a shared resource. If you perform revoke, the shared resource becomes unavailable for all the recipients that accepted it and the invitation link becomes invalid for subsequent usage. Refer to [DIAL API](https://epam-rail.com/dial_api#tag/Sharing/paths/~1v1~1ops~1resource~1share~1revoke/post) to view examples.
* `/copy` - this endpoint is used when you want to add an additional resource to a shared resource.  For example, you have shared a conversation with attachments and you add an additional attachment to it and want other users to have at as well in the share resource.
* `/invitations`: use this endpoint to query a list of all active invitations you have created. Refer to [DIAL API](https://epam-rail.com/dial_api#tag/Sharing/paths/~1v1~1invitations/get) to view examples.
* `/invitations/{Invitation ID}`: use this endpoint with DELETE method to revoke invitations. Refer to [DIAL API](https://epam-rail.com/dial_api#tag/Sharing/paths/~1v1~1invitations~1%7BInvitation%20ID%7D/delete) to view examples.

Endpoints for **resource recipient**:

* `/discard`: recipients of a shared resource can use this endpoint to stop using shared resources. In this case, related resources will stop being marked as shared for the resource owner. Refer to  [DIAL API](https://epam-rail.com/dial_api#tag/Sharing/paths/~1v1~1ops~1resource~1share~1discard/post) to view examples.
* `/list`: use this endpoint to query all the resources that were shared with you. In the request body, provide `me` as `with` parameter value. Refer to [DIAL API](https://epam-rail.com/dial_api#tag/Sharing/paths/~1v1~1ops~1resource~1share~1list/post)to view examples.
* `/invitations/{Invitation ID}`: use this endpoint with GET method to view invitation details and to **accept** an invitation. Refer to [DIAL API](https://epam-rail.com/dial_api#tag/Sharing/paths/~1v1~1invitations~1%7BInvitation%20ID%7D/get) to view examples.

### Workflow Examples

**Basic workflow**:

1. Resource owner shares a resource and provides the invitation link for the resource recipient.
2. Resource recipient extracts the invitation id from the invitation link to accept the resource.
3. Resource recipient can now get the list of shared resources with their details.

**Revoke workflow**:

1. Resource owner shares a resource and provides the invitation link for the resource recipient.
2. Resource recipient extracts the invitation id from the invitation link to accept the resource.
3. Resource owner revokes access to the shared resource.
4. Resource recipient cannot access the shared resource.

## DIAL Chat

Chat users can share their resources with other users and accept sharing invitations from other users and view the resources shared by them and shared with them. Shared conversations can include attachments. In this case, all attachments are shared as well and can be accessible in the chat file manager.
