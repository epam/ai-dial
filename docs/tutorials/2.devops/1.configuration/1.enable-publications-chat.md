# How to Enable Publications in DIAL Chat

Refer to [user guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#flow) to learn how chat users can use publications for conversations, prompts and applications.

To enable the publication feature in DIAL Chat:

### Step 1: Users

Create user hierarchy (including claims) in your identity service provider (IDP) and configure DIAL to work with it. Refer to [Authentication](/docs/platform/3.core/1.auth-intro.md) to view the supported IDPs and configuration guidelines.

### Step 2: DIAL Core

Configure DIAL Core to pass claims from your IDP with the corresponding rules for users. Refer to [configuration](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core) to view the description of parameters.

You can create your own rules according to access policies in your organization. 

The following is the default configuration. In it, for admins, the value `admin` in the claim `roles` must be present. 

```json
"access": {
  "admin": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "function": "CONTAIN",
        "source": "roles",
        "targets": ["admin"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 3: DIAL Chat

Configure DIAL Chat by including `ConversationsPublishing` and `PromptsPublishing` in the `ENABLED_FEATURES` variable. Refer to [configuration](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-chat/blob/development/apps/chat/README.md) to view the description of parameters and [examples](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-chat/blob/development/libs/shared/src/types/features.ts).
