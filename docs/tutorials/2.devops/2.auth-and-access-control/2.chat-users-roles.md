# Roles and Access Control for JWT

## Introduction

You can configure DIAL to work with various identity service providers, where you can manage your users and user groups. In the [DIAL Core Dynamic Settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-settings), you can enable roles and configure their access to system resources. 

> Refer to [About Roles](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md#about-roles) to learn more. 

## Step 1: Configure IDP

For DIAL Chat users, you can define user groups/roles/pools (it depends on a specific IDP) in your identity service provider (IDP) which are then passed to DIAL Core in JWT. 

> Refer to [Configure IDPs](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/3.configure-idps/0.overview.md) to view supported IDPs and learn how to configure them.

## Step 2: Configure DIAL Core

### Add Roles

You can then utilize user roles from the JWT claims to define roles in the DIAL Core dynamic settings as a `userRoles` parameter value. In the following example, we grant access to `chat-gpt-35-turbo` model for users with the `operator` user role. Using the same pattern, you can define user access to applications.

```json
"models": {
    "chat-gpt-35-turbo": {
        "userRoles": [
            "operator"
            ]
        }
}
```

> Refer to [DIAL Core Dynamic Settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-settings) to view the description of all the supported configuration parameters.

**IMPORTANT**: 

* Always use roles from the JWT claims that you receive from your IDP. 
* If a user's IDP roles aren't explicitly mentioned in the DIAL configuration, a "default" role is applied. 
* If the "default" role is not defined or has no limits set, access to the resource is **unrestricted**. 

### Add Limits

In the `roles` section of the DIAL Core dynamic settings, you can configure token usage and sharing limits for roles that apply to specific system resources. 

**Effective role rule**: 

* If a user has a role A and B from the IDP which are not mentioned in the `roles` section, limits from the `default` role apply. 
* If the `default` role is not defined in the `roles` section or does not have limits configured for it - the **access is unlimited**.

In this example, we define the `operator` role with `limits` for the `chat-gpt-35-turbo` model and sharing limits for applications and files. 

```json
"roles": {
    "operator": {
        "limits": {
            "chat-gpt-35-turbo": {
                "minute": "200000",
                "day": "10000000",
                "week": "10000000",
                "month": "10000000",
            }
        },
        "share": {
            "APPLICATION": {
                "invitation_ttl": "24",
                "max_accepted_users": "10"
                },
            "FILE": {
                "invitation_ttl": "24",
                "max_accepted_users": "10"
                }
        }
    }
}
```
