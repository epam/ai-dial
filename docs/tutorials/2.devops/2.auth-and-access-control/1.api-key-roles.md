# Roles and Access Control for API Keys

## Introduction

API keys can be used not only for [authentication](/docs/platform/3.core/1.auth-intro.md), but also to manage access to system resources and apply restrictions on such access. This is done via assigning of **roles** to API keys. Roles must be associated with specific system resources such as models and applications.

> Refer to [API Keys](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md#api-keys) to learn more.

## Step 1: Create API Key

You can define API keys in [DIAL Core dynamic settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-settings) in the `keys` section.

> Refer to [Create API Key](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/0.programmatic-auth.md#step-1-define-api-keys) to see details.

## Step 2: Assign Roles (Required)

You can define roles in [DIAL Core dynamic settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-settings) in the `roles` section.

> Refer to [Assign role(s)](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/0.programmatic-auth.md#step-2-assign-roles-required) to see details.

## Step 3: Configure Access and Restrictions

In the `roles` section of the DIAL Core dynamic settings, you can also include optional sharing and token usage limits for roles. 

**Note**: If limits are not configured the **access is unlimited**.
   
In the following example, we define the `basic` role with limits for the `chat-gpt-35-turbo` model and sharing limits for applications and files. 

> Refer to [dynamic settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-settings) to see other configuration options for roles.

        }
    }
}
