# Roles and Access Control for API Keys

API keys can be used not only for [authentication](/docs/platform/3.core/1.auth-intro.md), but also to manage access to system resources and apply restrictions on such access.

> Refer to [Platform](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md) to learn more about API Keys.

This is done via assigning of **roles** to API keys. Roles must be associated with specific system resources such as models and applications.

To create and configure access control for API keys:

1. [Create API Key](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/0.programmatic-auth.md#step-1-define-api-keys) 
2. [Assign role(s)](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/0.programmatic-auth.md#step-2-assign-roles-required) 
3. Add restrictions: 

    Roles used by API keys must be declared in the `roles` section. In the `roles` section, you can also include optional sharing and token usage limits for roles. 
    
    In the following example, we assign the `basic` role for `proxyKey1` API key. It grants access to the `chat-gpt-35-turbo` model with some restrictions.

    **Note**: If limits are not configured the **access is unlimited**.

    ```Json
    //Example extract from aidial.config.json
    "keys": {
        "proxyKey1": { //API key
            "project": "Project1",
            "role": "basic" // the name of the role
        }
    },
    "roles": {
        "basic": { // the name of the role
            "limits": {
                "chat-gpt-35-turbo": {
                "minute": "100000", //number of tokens per minute
                "day": "10000000", //number of tokens per day
                "week": "10000000", //number of tokens per week
                "month": "10000000", //number of tokens per month
                },
            "share": {
                "APPLICATION": {
                    "invitation_ttl": "24",
                    "max_accepted_users": "10"
                    },
                "FILE": {
                    "invitation_ttl": "24",
                    "max_accepted_users": "10"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
