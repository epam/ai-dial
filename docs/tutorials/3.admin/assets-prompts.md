# Prompts

## About Prompts

A prompt is an instruction, a question, or a message that a user provides to a language model to receive an answer. Prompts can also contain constraints or requirements. They help the model understand the task at hand and the types of responses that are expected. You can use prompts as templates for your messages, instructions to the model, or to encourage the model to generate specific types of content. In DIAL, you can create prompts beforehand and reuse them in one or several conversations.

> Refer to [DIAL Chat User Guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#prompts) to learn more about prompts and DIAL Chat features.

## Prompts Main Screen

In the Prompts section, you can manage all system and user prompt templates available in the Public folder. Here, you can also arrange prompts into folders, version them, and then use them in applications or chats.

> Refer to [Access Control](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md) to lean more about Private and Public logical spaces for objects storage in DIAL.
