# Interceptors

## About Interceptors

You can add an additional logic into the processing of every request and response for models and apps, enabling PII obfuscation, guardrails, safety checks, and beyond. This is achieved through the integration of pluggable components known as Interceptors. 

> Refer to [Interceptors](/docs/platform/3.core/6.interceptors.md) to learn more.

## Interceptors Main Screen

In Interceptors, you can find, manage and add interceptors to your DIAL environment.

##### Interceptors Grid

| Field      | Definition |
|---------------------------|-------|
| **Display Name**| A user-friendly name of the interceptor (e.g. "PII Information Remover"). |
| **Description** | A brief summary of what this interceptor does and any parameters it uses (e.g. BLACKLIST={"foo","bar"} or Logs request/response payloads).|
| **ID**     | A unique identifier for the interceptor (e.g. reject-blacklisted-words, audit-logger). This key is used when you attach it to a Model or Application. | 
| **Source Type** | Can be one of the following options: Interceptor Template, Interceptor Container, External Endpoint. |
| **Source** | Interceptor's Adapter ID, Interceptor Container Id or Completion Endpoint URL, depending on the choice of the Source Type.   |
| **Author** | Contains information about the interceptor's author.|


## Create

Follow these steps to add a new definition of an interceptor:

1. Click **+ Create** to invoke the **Create Interceptor** modal.
2. Define interceptor's parameters:

    | Column | Definition & Use      |
    |------------------|-------|
    | **ID** | A unique identifier for the interceptor (e.g. reject-blacklisted-words, audit-logger). This key is used when you attach it to a Model or Application. |
    | **Display Name** | A user-friendly name of the interceptor (e.g. "PII Information Remover"). |
    | **Description**  | A brief summary of what this interceptor does and any parameters it uses (e.g. BLACKLIST={"foo","bar"} or Logs request/response payloads).|
    | **Source Type** | Can be one of the following options: Interceptor Template, Interceptor Container, External Endpoint. |
    | **Adapter** | Interceptor's Adapter Id. Applies for the Template source type.   |
    | **Container** | Interceptor's Container Id. Applies for the Interceptor Container source type.  |
    | **Completion endpoint** | URL of the chat completion endpoint. Applies for the External Endpoint source type.    |
    | **Configuration endpoint** | The URL that exposes the configuration of the interceptor. Applies for the External Endpoint source type.   |

3. Once all required fields are filled, click **Create**. The dialog closes and the new interceptor [configuration screen](#configuration) is opened. Once added, a new entry appears in the **Interceptors** listing. It may take some time for the changes to take effect after saving.

| **Maintainer** | No| Field used to specify the responsible person or team overseeing the interceptor and its configuration. |
| **Forward Auth Token**     | No| Specify whether to forward an Auth Token to your interceptor's endpoint. Use this when your interceptor service requires its own authentication.     |
| **Source Type**| Yes         | Can be one of the following options: Interceptor Template, Interceptor Container, External Endpoint.|
| **Completion Endpoint**    | Conditional | URL of the chat completion endpoint. Applies for the External Endpoint source type. |
| **Configuration Endpoint** | Conditional    | The URL that exposes the configuration of the interceptor. Applies for the External Endpoint source type.  |
| **Adapter**   | Conditional | Interceptor's Adapter Id. Applies for the Template source type.      |
| **Container**  | Conditional | Interceptor's Container Id. Applies for the Interceptor Container source type.|
|**Defaults**|No|The interceptor configuration could be preset on the per-interceptor basis via the `defaults` field. Default parameters are applied if a request doesn't contain them in OpenAI chat/completions API call. Refer to [Interceptors SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-interceptors-sdk/blob/development/README.md#interceptor-configuration) to learn more.|


### Entities

In the Entities tab, you can see Models and Applications this interceptor is currently associated with. By binding interceptors here, you control exactly which AI endpoints (and in what order) will invoke your custom pre- or post-processing logic.

### JSON Editor

Use the **JSON Editor** toggle to switch between the form-based UI and raw JSON view of the interceptor’s configuration. It is useful for advanced scenarios of bulk updates, copy/paste between environments, or tweaking settings not exposed in the form UI—you can switch to the **JSON Editor** on any interceptor configuration page.

![](img/71.png)

##### Switching to the JSON Editor

1. Navigate to **Entities → Interceptors**, then select the interceptor you want to edit.
2. Click the **JSON Editor** toggle (top-right). The UI reveals the raw JSON.

> **TIP**: You can switch between UI and JSON only if there are no unsaved changes.

### Delete

Use the **Delete** button in the Configuration screen toolbar to permanently remove the selected interceptor.
