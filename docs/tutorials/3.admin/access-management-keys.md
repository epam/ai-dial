## About API Keys

DIAL Core uses API keys to manage access of external applications for resources in DIAL.

> Refer to [Access Control](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md) to learn more about access control in DIAL.

## Keys Main Screen

On the main screen you can see all existing API keys with their details.

##### Keys Grid

> **TIP**: Use the **Columns** selector to customize which columns are visible in the grid.

| Column                    | Definition                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Roles

API keys must be associated with a specific role in DIAL Core to be valid. Roles give access to specific DIAL resources and can impose usage and cost limits.

In the Roles tab, you can associate the selected API key with existing [roles](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/access-management-roles.md).

![](img/img_45.png)

| Column    | Description|
| --------------- |-----------------------------------------------|
| **Name**  | A unique identifier of the role.     |
| **Description** | User-friendly summary of the Role‚Äôs purpose. |

#### Add

To associate one or more roles with the selected API key:

1. Click **+ Add** (top-right of the Roles Grid).
2. **Select** one or more roles in the modal window. Roles are defined in the [Access Management ‚Üí Roles](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/access-management-roles.md) section.
3. **Confirm** to insert them into the table.

#### Remove

Use to stop associating API keys with roles. 
 
1. Click the **actions** menu in the role's line.
2. Choose **Remove** in the menu.

> To delete a role, go to the [Access Management ‚Üí Roles](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/access-management-roles.md) section.

### JSON Editor

For advanced scenarios of bulk updates, copy/paste between environments, or tweaking settings not exposed in the form UI‚Äîyou can switch to the **JSON Editor** in any key's configuration page.

![](img/75.png)

##### Switching to the JSON Editor

1. Navigate to **Access Management ‚Üí Keys**, then select the key you want to edit.
2. Click the **JSON Editor** toggle (top-right). The UI reveals the raw JSON.

> **TIP**: You can switch between UI and JSON only if there are no unsaved changes.


## Delete

Click **Delete** on the main screen to permanently remove the selected key. 

> **Note**: All related entities (applications, models, routes) bound to the deleted API key will fail.
