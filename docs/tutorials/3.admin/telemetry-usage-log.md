# Usage Log

## Introduction

The **Usage Log** provides comprehensive visibility into all interactions within your DIAL environment by capturing **traces**—individual end-to-end exchanges between users and DIAL entities (applications or models). 

Each trace represents a complete request-response cycle, from the initial user prompt through to the final model output, including all associated metadata such as token counts, costs, and performance metrics.

The Usage Log offers two complementary views:
- **Traces Tab**: Displays individual traces with granular details for in-depth analysis of specific interactions
- **Conversations Tab**: Groups related traces into conversation sessions, enabling you to review aggregated metrics and understand multi-turn dialogue patterns

This dual perspective allows you to analyze usage patterns at both the micro (individual trace) and macro (conversation session) levels, supporting effective monitoring, cost optimization, and performance analysis.

##### Top Bar Controls

* **Time Period**: Dropdown control to scope the table to a specific time range (e.g., last 24 hours, last 7 days, or custom date range).
* **Refresh**: Click to manually reload the table with the latest data, applying all active filters and respecting the selected time period. This ensures you're viewing the most current traces and conversations without needing to reload the entire page.

## Traces

The **Traces Tab** displays individual traces in a tabular format, where each row represents a single end-to-end interaction between a user and a DIAL entity (application or model). This granular view enables detailed analysis of individual requests, including token consumption, costs, performance metrics, and execution paths. Use this tab to investigate specific interactions, troubleshoot issues, or analyze usage patterns at the trace level.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Completion Time** | Timestamp when the trace finished processing (end-to-end interaction). |
| **Trace ID** | Unique identifier of the trace (one end-to-end interaction). |
| **Topic** | Auto-generated subject/title summarizing the trace. |
| **Reactions** | Indication of user reactions presence (like/dislike) for the trace. |
| **Cached prompt tokens** | Number of prompt tokens served from cache (prompt-caching). |
| **Prompt tokens** | Number of tokens in the prompt sent to the model for this trace. |
| **Completion tokens** | Number of tokens generated by the model as output for this trace. |
| **Deployment price** | Cost attributed to the selected deployment for this trace. |
| **Total price** | Total cost of the trace. |
| **Number of request messages** | Number of discrete request messages that were included in the trace. |
| **Deployment ID** | Identifier of the DIAL deployment used to serve this trace. |
| **Parent Deployment ID** | Identifier of the parent deployment (e.g., application that was using the underlying model). |
| **Model** | Identifier of the underlying AI model used to carry out the trace. |
| **Project** | Related project in DIAL. |
| **Upstream** | The upstream endpoint (e.g., completions endpoint of the model). |
| **Execution path** | Execution path of the trace. |
| **User** | Identifier of the end user who initiated the trace. |
| **User title** | The name of the user (if available). |
| **Language** | Language detected in the trace (e.g., `en`). |
| **Duration** | Total end-to-end duration of the trace from first request to completion. |
| **Response ID** | Identifier of the response object returned by the AI model for this trace. |
| **Conversation ID** | Identifier of the conversation/session this trace belongs to. |
| **Code span ID** | Identifier of a specific code execution span associated with the trace (if any). |
| **Code span parent ID** | Identifier of the parent span for a code execution span (if any). |

## Conversations

The **Conversations Tab** aggregates related traces into cohesive user sessions, providing a conversation-level view of interactions within DIAL. Each row represents a complete conversation session, displaying aggregated metrics such as total token consumption, cumulative costs, and activity timelines. This view enables you to analyze multi-turn dialogues, track user engagement patterns, and monitor resource utilization across entire conversation flows rather than isolated interactions.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Last activity** | Timestamp of the most recent trace within the conversation. |
| **Conversation ID** | Unique identifier of the user session that groups related traces. |
| **Topic** | Auto-generated subject summarizing the conversation. |
| **Cached prompt tokens** | Count of prompt tokens served from cache across the conversation. |
| **Prompt tokens** | Total number of request/prompt tokens sent to the AI model across all traces in the conversation. |
| **Completion tokens** | Total number of tokens generated by the AI model across all traces in the conversation. |
| **Total price** | Aggregated cost of the conversation. |
| **Number of request messages** | Total number of discrete request messages included in the conversation. |
| **Deployment ID** | Identifier of the deployment associated with the conversation. |
| **Project** | Related project in DIAL. |
| **User** | Identifier of the end user who initiated the conversation. |
| **User title** | Name of the user (if available). |
| **Language** | Detected language for the conversation (e.g., `en`). |
