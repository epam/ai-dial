# Usage Log

## About Usage Log

The Usage Log records Traces—each one a single end-to-end interaction between a user and a DIAL entity (application or model). 
It also records Conversations, which group related traces into complete user sessions so administrators can review details and see aggregated metrics at the conversation level.

##### Top Bar Controls

* **Time Period** filter: A dropdown control that scopes the table to a custom period range.
* **Refresh** button: Manually refreshes the entries on the page honoring all active filters and the selected **Time Period** to pull the latest audit events

## Traces Tab

Tab shows individual Traces. Each entry represents a single end-to-end interaction of a DIAL entity with an underlying model.
