# Usage Log

## Introduction

Each request to DIAL Core deployment (model or application) initiated by external of internal client may result in a complex sequence of calls between DIAL applications and AI models. All requests within this call sequence share a single Trace ID, allowing you to track the entire end-to-end interaction. Additionally, each request is assigned a unique Core span ID, so the combination of Trace ID and Core span ID uniquely identifies every request.

The **Usage Log** provides comprehensive visibility into all requests processed by DIAL Core. It offers two complementary views: **Traces** for granular request-level details (token consumption, costs, performance metrics, execution paths), and **Conversations** for aggregated conversation-level metrics. 

##### Top Bar Controls

* **Time Period**: Dropdown control to scope the table to a specific time range (e.g., last 24 hours, last 7 days, or custom date range).
* **Refresh**: Click to manually reload the table with the latest data, applying all active filters and respecting the selected time period. This ensures you're viewing the most current traces and conversations without needing to reload the entire page.

## Traces

In **Traces** you can access a detailed view into all requests processed by DIAL Core. Each row represents an individual request—whether initiated by an external or internal DIAL client. Use it to investigate specific interactions, troubleshoot issues, or analyze usage patterns at both the trace and individual request level.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Completion Time** | Timestamp when the trace finished processing (end-to-end interaction). |
| **Duration** | Total end-to-end duration of the trace from first request to completion. |
| **Number of request messages** | The number indicates the chat conversation length in chat completion requests and the input count in embedding requests. |
| **Trace ID** | OpenTelemetry trace ID uniquely identifying requests to DIAL Core resulted from a single end-to-end interaction. |
| **Response ID** | Identifier of the response object returned by the AI model for this trace. |
| **Conversation ID** | DIAL Chat conversation identifier the given request belongs to. |
| **Core span ID** | OpenTelemetry span ID generated by DIAL Core. |
| **Core span parent ID** | OpenTelemetry span ID generated by DIAL Core that called the given request. |
| **Deployment ID** | Identifier of the DIAL deployment corresponding to the given request. |
| **Parent Deployment ID** | Identifier of the DIAL parent deployment that called the given request. |
| **Prompt tokens** | Number of tokens in the prompt sent to the model for this trace. |
| **Cached prompt tokens** | Number of prompt tokens served from cache (prompt-caching). |
| **Completion tokens** | Number of tokens generated by the model as output for this trace. |
| **Deployment price** | The cost of the specific request in the call graph, excluding the cost of any requests it directly or indirectly initiated. |
| **Total price** | The total cost of the request, including the cost of this request and all related requests it directly or indirectly triggered. It always holds that `Deployment price >= Total price`. |
| **Model** | Identifier of the underlying AI model used to carry out the trace. |
| **Project** | Project ID corresponding to the DIAL API Key via which the given request was made. |
| **Upstream** | The upstream endpoint (e.g., completions endpoint of the model). |
| **Execution path** | A list of DIAL deployment IDs representing the call stack of the given request. |
| **User** | Hashed identifier of the end user who initiated the trace. |
| **User title** | Title of the user (if available). |
| **Topic** | Auto-generated subject/title summarizing the trace. |
| **Language** | Language detected in the trace (e.g., `en`). |
| **Reactions** | Indication of user reactions presence (like/dislike) for the trace. |

## Conversations

In **Conversations** you can access a detailed view into all requests to DIAL Core deployments (model or application) initiated by external of internal client aggregated into conversations. Each row represents a conversation session, displaying aggregated metrics such as total token consumption, cumulative costs, and activity timelines. This view enables you to analyze multi-turn dialogues, track user engagement patterns, and monitor resource utilization across entire conversation flows rather than isolated interactions.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Last activity** | Timestamp of the most recent trace within the conversation. |
| **Conversation ID** | DIAL Chat conversation identifier the given request belongs to. |
| **Deployment ID** | Identifier of the DIAL deployment corresponding to the given request. |
| **Prompt tokens** | Total number of request/prompt tokens sent to the AI model across all traces in the conversation. |
| **Cached prompt tokens** | Number of prompt tokens served from cache (prompt-caching). |
| **Completion tokens** | Total number of tokens generated by the AI model across all traces in the conversation. |
| **Total price** | The total cost of the request, including the cost of this request and all related requests it directly or indirectly triggered. It always holds that `Deployment price >= Total price`. |
| **Number of request messages** | The number indicates the chat conversation length in chat completion requests and the input count in embedding requests. |
| **Project** | Project ID corresponding to the DIAL API Key via which the given request was made. |
| **User** | Hashed identifier of the end user who initiated the trace. |
| **User title** | Title of the user (if available). |
| **Topic** | Auto-generated subject summarizing the conversation. |
| **Language** | Detected language for the conversation (e.g., `en`). |
