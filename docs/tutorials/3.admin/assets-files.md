## About Files

Files in DIAL are arbitrary binary or text assets (JSON, CSV, PDF, images, etc.) your models and applications can reference at runtime.

## Files Main Screen

In Files, you can manage all files in the Public folder.

> Refer to [Access Control](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md) to lean more about Private and Public logical spaces for objects storage in DIAL.

### Folders Structure

Objects in the [Public space](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md) are arranged hierarchically, similar to a file system. In this part of the screen, you can see the hierarchical structure of folders in the Public space.

| **Sub-folders**        | Files can be placed in a specific sub-folder for logical organization purposes.          |
| **+ (Create)**         | Hover over any folder to display this action. Allows creating new child or sibling folder and import the files into it. Same flow as [Import](#import), but also requires to provide a folder name. |
