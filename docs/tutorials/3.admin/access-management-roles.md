> * Refer to [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/0.api-keys.md) to learn how to configure roles for API keys.
> * Refer to [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/1.jwt.md) to learn how to configure roles for JWT.
> * Refer to [IDP Configurations](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/0.overview.md) to learn about the supported identity service providers and how to configure them.

## Roles Main Screen

In Roles, you can define and manage roles in DIAL. 

> Roles can also be defined directly in [DIAL Core configuration](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core/blob/development/docs/dynamic-settings/roles.md).
