# Notifications

## Introduction

AI DIAL API support two slightly different types of notifications: notifications and subscribe.

> Note, that currently this functionality is available only via API. We are working on supporting it in AI DIAL Chat UI.

## Notification API

You can use [Notification API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Notifications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1notification~1list/post) to receive notifications about changes in specific **workflows** such as [publications](docs/tutorials/2.devops/1.configuration/1.enable-publications-chat.md). For example, when a publication request has been approved or rejected. 

Notification API allows [getting all your notifications](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Notifications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1notification~1list/post) and [deleting](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Notifications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1notification~1delete/post) them.

This API has a **pull-based** approach: you need to actively make a request to retrieve the notifications.

## Subscribe API

[Subscribe API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Notifications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1resource~1subscribe/post) allows receiving notifications about changes such as DELETE, CREATE, UPDATE made to DIAL resources such as applications, files, conversations and prompts.

This API has a **push-based** approach: once you subscribe, the API will automatically send notifications whenever a relevant event occurs.
