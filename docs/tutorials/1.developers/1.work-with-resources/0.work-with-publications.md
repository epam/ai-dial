# Publications

## Introduction

When you create resources in DIAL such as conversations, prompts, toolsets or applications, they are stored in a private space of your user and accessible only to you. You can publish/unpublish your private resources making them accessible for other users in DIAL.

> * Refer to [Access Control](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md#authorization-mechanisms) to learn about public and private resources in DIAL.

By default, any published resource becomes available to all users. You can define access rules when making a publication request to limit access to them.

When a resource is published, it becomes available in the public folder in the DIAL file system and users can access it in DIAL Chat and [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md).

## Publication API

DIAL provides a set of REST API endpoints to work with publications programmatically.

> * Refer to [DIAL API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications) to view publications endpoints.
> * Refer to [DIAL Chat User Guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#publications) to learn how chat users can publish resources in DIAL Chat.

### User Flow

You can create a publication request by calling [/v1/ops/publication/create](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1publication~1create/post) endpoint. You can use it to create a mixed publication request, in which you can pass various resources in the request body with different action types. 

For example, you can pass a collection of new prompts with action type `ADD` and another collection of prompts with action type `DELETE`. This way you can **publish** one set of prompts and **unpublish** the other. Similarly, you can handle other resource types (FILE, PROMPT, CONVERSATION, APPLICATION and TOOLSET). 

In the response, you get an object with the `PENDING` status, which is awaiting the action from the admin: approve or reject. While your request is pending, you can delete it by calling [/v1/ops/publication/delete](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1publication~1delete/post) endpoint.

#### Access Control

When making a publication request, the author can specify the `targetFolder` for the published resource and provide `rules` to restrict access. 

> Refer to [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/1.jwt.md) to learn how to restrict access to resources added via the direct modification of the DIAL Core config.

##### Get a list of rules for a specific folder

Call [/v1/ops/publication/rules/list](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1publication~1rules~1list/post) endpoint to get a list of all rules for the provided path (folder sequence). 

##### Change rules for a specific folder

Call a [/v1/ops/publication/create](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1publication~1create/post) endpoint providing a path to a desired folder (`targetFolder`in the request body) and a list of rules to be changed. For instance, if you create a request with `"targetFolder":"public/folder1/folder2/"`, it will only overwrite the rules for `folder2`, while the rules for `folder1` will stay unchanged.

##### Create a publication request without changing rules

Create a [/v1/ops/publication/create](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1publication~1create/post) request without the `rules` object to left the rules intact.

##### Effective Rules

> Refer to [Access Control](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md#hierarchical-structure-of-the-public-space) to learn more about folder structure in public space and how to define access restrictions.

The effective access rules for a folder structure can be described as follows:

1. Within a single folder, the effective access rule is determined by the logical OR operation applied to all the access rules assigned to that folder. For example, in folder A with access rules a, b, and c, the effective rule is "a OR b OR c".
2. Between nested folders, the effective access rule is determined by the logical AND operation applied between the effective rules of the parent folder and its subfolder. For example, if folder B with access rules d, e, and f is nested under folder A, the effective rule for accessing folder B is "(a OR b OR c) AND (d OR e OR f)".

### Admin Flow

DIAL Admins can get a list of publication requests awaiting the decision by calling [/v1/ops/publication/list ](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1publication~1list/post) endpoint. Further, you can call [/v1/ops/publication/get](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1publication~1get/post) endpoint to get a specific publication request and then execute [/v1/ops/publication/approve](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1publication~1approve/post) or [/v1/ops/publication/reject](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications/paths/~1v1~1ops~1publication~1reject/post) to change its status.
