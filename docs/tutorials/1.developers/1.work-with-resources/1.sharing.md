# Sharing

## Introduction

In DIAL, [resources](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/1.concepts.md) refers to conversations, prompts, files, and applications. When a resource is created or uploaded to DIAL, it is stored in a dedicated [storage bucket](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/2.architecture.md#persistent-layer). You can use both DIAL Chat UI and API to share resources with other users or applications.

When a resource is shared, it becomes available in DIAL Chat and [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md), where users (with whom the resource has been shared) can discover and utilize it.

## DIAL API

There are two sides in the sharing process: the resource owner and the resource recipient. DIAL [Sharing API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing) has endpoints to facilitate workflows for either of them.

### Endpoints for resource owners

This table lists endpoints that resource owners can use to share resources and manage shared resources:

| Endpoint                                                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`create`](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing/operation/shareResource)                         | Resource owners can use this endpoint to share a resource by creating an `invitationLink` which includes an `invitationId`.<br />**Permissions**:<br />- You can grant **READ** or **WRITE** access to your resource. **Note**: If an app/user changes the shared resource, HTTP **etag** is used by DIAL Core to determine versioning and resolve conflicts. You can use [Subscription API](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/1.work-with-resources/2.notifications.md#subscriptions) to get notifications about changes made by other users or applications.<br />- Include a **SHARE** permission to enable recipients of the shared resource to re-share it with **READ** permissions. Use `maxAcceptedUsers` to apply limits on the number of users who can accept the invitation link - the default value is unlimited. Refer to [Re-Sharing](#re-sharing) to learn more.<br />**Limitations**:<br />- The system does not support getting all the recipients of a shared resource.<br />- SHARE permission can be used only in combination with other permission types.<br />- Re-sharing is possible only with READ permission. |
| [`copy`](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing/operation/copySharedResources)                     | Use this endpoint to add permissions for users to access a new resource.<br />If a conversation with attachments has already been shared and a new attachment is added, this endpoint ensures that other users can access the updated shared resource, including the newly added attachment.<br />This ensures proper access control for all shared components of the resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [`list`](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing/operation/getSharedResources)                      | Use this endpoint to query the details of all resources that were shared by you. In the request body, provide `"with": "others"` to do that.<br />**Note**, that in case you share a conversation with attachments, attachments are shared as well, but they will appear in the response as a separate shared resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [`revoke`](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing/operation/revokeSharedResources)                 | Use this endpoint if you want to stop sharing a resource. As a result, the shared content becomes inaccessible to all recipients who previously had access to it, and any invitation link associated with it will no longer be valid for future use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [`invitations`](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing/operation/getInvitations)                   | Invitations are created together with sharing resources using `/create` endpoint. Use `/invitations` endpoint to query a list of all active invitations you have created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Endpoints for resource recipients

This table lists endpoints that resource recipients can use to accept invitations and manage shared resources:

| Endpoint                                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`discard`](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing/operation/discardSharedResources)            | Recipients of a shared resource can use this endpoint to stop using shared resources. In this case, related resources will stop being marked as shared for the resource owner.                                                          |
| [`list`](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing/operation/getSharedResources)                   | Use this endpoint to query the details of all resources that were shared with you. In the request body, provide `"with": "me"` to do that.                                                                                              |
| [`invitations/{Invitation ID}`](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing/operation/getInvitation) | Use this endpoint with the **GET** method to view invitation details and to **accept** an invitation.                                                                                                                                   |
| [`create`](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing/operation/shareResource)                      | Resource recipients can use this endpoint to **re-share** a resource by creating an `invitationLink` which includes an `invitationId`.<br />**Permissions**:<br />- You can grant **READ** access to the resource you want to re-share. |

### Workflow Examples

#### Basic workflow

1. Resource owner shares a resource using the `/create` and provides the invitation link for the resource recipient.
2. Resource recipient extracts the invitation id from the invitation link calls the `/invitations/{Invitation ID}` endpoint to accept the resource.
3. Resource recipient can now get the list of shared resources with their details via `/list`.

#### Revoke workflow

1. Resource owner shares a resource via `/create` and provides the invitation link for the resource recipient.
2. Resource recipient extracts the invitation id from the invitation link and calls the `/invitations/{Invitation ID}` to accept the resource.
3. Resource owner revokes access to the shared resource via `/revoke`.
4. Resource recipient cannot access the shared resource any longer.

#### Re-share workflow

1. Resource owner shares a resource via `/create` (with the **SHARE** permission type) and provides the invitation link for the resource recipient.
2. Resource recipient extracts the invitation id from the invitation link and calls the `/invitations/{Invitation ID}` to accept the resource.
3. Resource recipient can **re-share** the resource using the `/create` endpoint and provide the new invitation link for the new resource recipient.
4. New resource recipient extracts the invitation id from the invitation link and calls the `/invitations/{Invitation ID}` to accept the resource.
5. New resource recipient can now get the list of shared resources with their details via `/list`.

### Re-Sharing

Resource owners can share resources with the **SHARE** permission type, which allows resource recipients to re-share the resource with other users or applications. When a resource is re-shared, the new recipient can only access the resource with **READ** permissions.

In the re-sharing case, a specific validation takes place:

- The DIAL Core API will validate if the resource can be re-shared by examining if the resource's owner shared the resource with the permission `SHARE`. Otherwise, DIAL Core returns 400.
- The DIAL Core API will validate invitation TTL by taking the `invitation_ttl` value from the [DIAL Core dynamic settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-settings).
- The DIAL Core API will validate the permission set for the re-shared resource. The permission WRITE is not allowed to re-share resources: DIAL Core returns 400(Invalid permissions set. The permission READ is allowed for re-sharing only).
- The DIAL Core API will validate the number of accepted invites per shared resource (based on `max_accepted_users` in the [DIAL Core dynamic settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-settings)) and per invitation request (based on `maxAcceptedUsers` in the original share request).
