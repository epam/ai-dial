# Integration of DIAL with Continue

## Introduction

DIAL is an open platform that integrates with external systems, libraries, and frameworks to enhance and extend their existing functionalities. This document explains the integration of DIAL with the [Continue](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) - AI-powered code assistant, similar to a copilot.

The purpose of this integration is to enable VS Code users use the Continue code assistant with DIAL models.

This implementation also serves as a practical example of DIAL's integration with other systems.

## DIAL Extension

To enable this integration, we developed a VS Code extension that automatically modifies the Continue's VS Code extension `config.json` file with configuration data from DIAL Core, based on the authenticated user (e.g., logged-in user and access tokens). This way a DIAL user can use Continue code assistant with DIAL models available to this user and within limits defined in DIAL Core configuration.

> Watch a [demo video](/docs/video%20demos/3.Developers/Integrations/8.dial-continue.md) to see this integration in action.

### Features

These are the main features of the DIAL VS Code extension:

- **Secure Authentication**: The extension uses the PKCE flow with Keycloak for a secure authentication of users.
- **Automatic Token Management**: It refreshes tokens automatically before they expire to ensure uninterrupted access.
- **Configuration File Generation**: The extension automatically creates configuration files required for Continue based on DIAL Core settings.
- **Customizable Settings**: The extension's configuration allows you to define settings specific for your DIAL environment: authentication hosts, realms, and client IDs.

### Installation

DIAL Plugin is not available on the Visual Studio Marketplace, follow these steps to install it manually:

1.  Send us a request to get the latest `.vsix` file.
2.  In VS Code Extensions, click on the three-dot menu in the top right corner of the Extensions pane and select **Install from VSIX...**. Run the `.vsix` file to install both DIAL and Continue extensions.

4.  Reload VS Code to activate the extension.
5.  Click Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) to open the Command Palette and type in `AI DIAL: Auth` to authenticate with DIAL. Once authenticated, the extension will automatically generate the necessary configuration files for Continue, allowing you to use DIAL models with the Continue extension.
