# Integration between AI DIAL and Microsoft Copilot

## Introduction

AI DIAL is an open platform designed to avoid vendor lock-in, enabling seamless integration with external General AI (GenAI) applications, other AI-enabling systems, custom libraries and frameworks on any cloud or chosen environment. Being an orchestration platform, AI DIAL works alongside other AI-enabling systems to augment and expand their functionalities.

This document provides a detailed guide on how to create a MS Power Platform connector for AI DIAL. This connector can be used in MS Copilot Studio prompt flows, facilitating smooth interaction between the systems for creating comprehensive business solutions.

> Watch a [demo video](/docs/video%20demos/3.Developers/Integrations/13.dial-copilot.md) to see this integration in action.

There are two authentication types available for AI DIAL:

* API key
* End-user identity (OAuth2)

The chapters in this document will explain the specifics of integration based on the chosen type of authentication.

### Limitations

* Users can't send attachments to MS Copilot Studio agents: Although the underlying language model supports attachments, MS Copilot users currently cannot pass them to an agent when making a request, either through the UI or the API. For more details, refer to the MS Copilot Studio [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/publication-fundamentals-publish-channels?tabs=web).
* MS Copilot Studio does not support image generation or diagramming. For more details, refer to the Microsoft [community forum](https://community.powerplatform.com/forums/thread/details/?threadid=178879d8-dd5e-4d10-99df-4e8293affb6e).

## Auth with End-user Identity

### Prerequisites

* AI DIAL API is exposed to the Internet (required for OAuth2 authentication).
* AI DIAL API application registration in Azure has Application ID URI and at least one scope configured in the **Expose API** section. AI DIAL Application ID must be known.
* Open API definition YAML file for DIAL API is available.

### Step 1: Entra ID Application Registration

Create an Entra ID application registration for the custom connector:

1.	In **Entra ID -> App registrations** click **New registration**.
2.	Populate **Name** (leave the remaining fields as is) and click **Register**.
3.	Go to **Certificates & secrets** in the properties of the newly created registration and click **New client secret**.

4.	Provide a **Name** for the secret and click **Add**.
5.	Copy the generated secret value to a secure place, from where it can be subsequently retrieved.
6.	Got to **API permissions** in the properties of the newly created registration and click **Add a permission**.

7.	On the **APIs my organization uses** tab, find an application registration associated with the AI DIAL API.

8.	On the next screen, select all scopes exposed by the AI DIAL application registration and click **Add permissions**:

### Step 2: Create Connector in Copilot Studio

1.	In the custom topic, where AI DIAL needs to be called, click **+** and select **Call an action** and then select **Add a plugin action** in the **Plugin** tab.

2.	In the new window, click **Custom connector** and select **Add an API for a custom connector**.

3.	In the new window, at the **Upload specification** step, select the file containing the DIAL API YAML specification and click **Next**.

4.	Populate API plugin details and click **Next**. If you want to put the new custom connector to an existing Power Platform solution, select this solution in the corresponding field.

5.	At the **Authentication** step, select **OAuth (2.0)** authentication type and populate the remaining fields according to the following instructions:

  - **Client ID** - the GUID from the **Application (client) ID** property of the application registration created for this custom connector.
  - **Client Secret** - the secret generated when creating the application registration.
  - **Authorization URL** - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`, where `{tenant}` is a placeholder for your Entra ID tenant identifier.
  - **Token URL** - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token`
  - **Refresh URL** - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token`
  - **Scope** - openid profile email `offline_access {DIAL Application ID}/.default`, where `{DIAL Application ID}` is the application identifier of the AI DIAL API.

6.	At the **Select Actions** step, select the API method you need to call (e.g. completion).

  ![](../img/10.png)

7.	Populate the action **Name** and **Description**.
8.	Populate description for all input and output parameters.
9.	Proceed to publish.
10.	In Copilot Studio, navigate to **Solutions** and choose the solution that was created when you set up the custom connector. This solution will have the same name as the custom connector.

  ![](../img/11.png)

11.	Find the custom connector in the selected solution and click on it.
12.	Copy the redirect URL shown on the custom connector page.

  ![](../img/12.png)

13.	To proceed, open the Azure Application Registration created in the previous section and navigate to **Authentication**.

  ![](../img/13.png)

14.	Click **Add platform**, select **Web**, paste the copied Redirect URL, and click **Configure**.
15. The custom connector actions can now be added to the prompt flow within the Copilot Studio topic.

## Auth with API Key and DIAL API Exposed to the Internet

### Prerequisites

* DIAL API is exposed to the Internet.
* Open API definition YAML file for DIAL API is available.

### Create Connector in Copilot Studio

1. Perform **steps 1-4** from the section [Create Connector in Copilot Studio](#step-2-create-connector-in-copilot-studio).
3. Select **API Key** authentication type and populate the required fields as shown on the screenshot.

  ![](../img/14.png)

3. Perform **steps 6-9** from the section [Create Connector in Copilot Studio](#step-2-create-connector-in-copilot-studio).

## Auth with API Key and DIAL API NOT Exposed to the Internet

### Prerequisites

* An [on-premises data gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install) is installed within the on-premises network and DIAL API is reachable from the machine it is installed on.
* Open API definition YAML file for DIAL API is available.

### Create Connector in Copilot Studio

1. Patch the Open API definition YAML file for DIAL API to add one more parameter to each method specifying the API Key:

    ```yaml
    - name: Api-Key
      in: header
      required: true
      schema:
        type: string
    ```

2. Perform **steps 1-4** from the section [Create Connector in Copilot Studio](#step-2-create-connector-in-copilot-studio).
3. Select **None** authentication type.
4. Perform **steps 6-9** from the section [Create Connector in Copilot Studio](#step-2-create-connector-in-copilot-studio).
5. In Copilot Studio, navigate to **Solutions** and choose the solution that was created when you set up the custom connector. This solution will have the same name as the custom connector.

    ![](../img/15.png)

6. Find the custom connector in the selected solution and click on it.
7. In the Power Automate page for the selected custom connector click **Edit**.
8. Set the checkmark **Connect via on-premises data gateway** in the custom connector properties and update the definition.
