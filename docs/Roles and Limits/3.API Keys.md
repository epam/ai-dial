# Roles and Limits for API Keys

API keys can be used not only for [authentication](/Auth/programmatic-auth), but also to restrict access to system resources and apply limits on a number of request that can be sent to them.

This is done via assigning of **roles** to API keys. Roles can be associated with specific system resources such as models, applications, addons and assistants and have limits.

1. [Create API Key](/Auth/programmatic-auth#step-1-define-api-keys)
2. [Create role(s)](/Roles%20and%20Limits/overview#roles) and [limit(s)](/Roles%20and%20Limits/overview#limits)
3. [Assign role](/Auth/programmatic-auth#step-2-assign-roles) to API key
