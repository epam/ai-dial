# Roles and Limits for Chat Users

You can configure roles and limits for chat users to restrict access to specific system resources. 

1. Configure your IDP to work with AI DIAL for users authentication. Refer to [Auth](/Auth/Web/overview) to learn how to do this.
2. In AI DIAL, add `userRoles` parameter to system resources such as models, applications, addons and assistants to grant access to it for a specific group of users, configured in your IDP. In this example for MS Entra IDP, `"azure-group-name"` role from the `"groups"` claim is configured for `chat-gpt-35-turbo` model:

    ```json
    "models": {
        "chat-gpt-35-turbo": {
        "type": "chat",
        "endpoint" : "http://localhost:7001/v1/openai/deployments/gpt-35-turbo/chat/completions",
        "upstreams": [
            {"endpoint": "http://localhost:7001", "key": "modelKey1"}
        ],
        "userRoles": ["azure-group-name"]
        }
    }
    ```

3. You can add limits for any role to restrict the number of requests to the resource the role is associated with. Refer to [Limits](/Roles%20and%20Limits/overview#limits) to learn more about them.

    ```json
    "roles": {
        "azure-group-name": {
            "limits": {
                "chat-gpt-35-turbo": {
                    "minute": "200000",
                    "day": "10000000"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
