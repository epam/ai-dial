# Release Notes

The purpose of this document is to provide a quick summary of all the biggest new features added in this version and provide some additional description, video, or tutorials for major features. They will be grouped into blocks by functionality.

## Brief Summary

The highlights of this release are significant improvements to DIAL's **Quick Apps** functionality, **multimodality** enhancements with Sora and TTS/STT support, **global interceptors**, and **improved feedback collection**. Feel free to watch a video showcase of the past month's biggest changes below:

## Major Enhancements

**Multimodality**: Do you want to literally *talk* with your data, or *see* it come to life? With the announce of Sora, as well as enhancements to OpenAI's Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech models, we made sure that DIAL can handle video and audio attachments natively in the chat UI. If video generation or voice-recognition is an important part of your AI use-cases, or you just want to experiment, DIAL can bring it into your environment. Remember - the "I" in DIAL stands for Integrator, and we are always making sure the latest and greatest models can integrate seamlessly into your AI ecosystem.

**Collect comments in response feedback**: In a complex ecosystem with hundreds of models and agents, "what's the best model or agent for this task?" is rapidly becoming a million dollar question. DIAL allows you to collect the data you need to make an informed decision, supporting full-text comments for responses in addition to "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" feedback.

**Support interceptors on global or application type level**: Using AI responsibly within enterprises remains a key challenge as we move to 2026. This feature allows interceptors to be deployed for _all_ instances of a certain application type - for example, an admin can now specify that all Quick Apps must use a PII Anonymizer interceptor, even ones that aren't published. Similarly, global interceptors can enable _all_ requests and responses to models or agents to be routed through specified interceptors on an enterprise level. For more information about interceptors and why they are useful, please conduct the documentation or watch the tutorial video below.

**Quick Apps Code Interpreter and Attachment Support**: One of the pain points users report when working with AI tools is that they can't handle or render specific output files. Within QuickApps, we now support a built-in code interpreter, which allows DIAL Chat to execute agent-generated Python code directly within the user interface. In addition, we improved support for different attachment types within Quick Apps, which allows us to handle video- and audio-attachments directly in-line with conversations. With Quick Apps 2.0, agents can also pass these outputs to other agents as well, allowing users to create their own customized workflows with several agents chained together. For more information about Quick Apps 2.0 in general, please check out the video below:

## Additional Notes

For full release notes with all bug fixes and additional features, please check the release tags below (ALIAKSANDR - please help compile these links). Here is a non-exhaustive list of other features added in this version.

* **Improve how models and agents share files with each other"**: This feature improves agents' ability to communicate and interact with each other, to allow files and other materials to be shared not just within the context of the individual application, but in scenarios where we orchestrate between several agents at once. For example, DIAL can now pass indexes generated by DIAL RAG with Mind Map applications. 
* **Vertex Adapters**: add Claude 4.1 and 4.5 models and support for gemini-embedding-001
* **Bedrock Adapter**: Support Stability Image Core/Ultra iteration 1, and native document understanding (file upload) 

* Support **multiple identity providers** concurrently in Admin panel
