## Description

combines Cloud Search APIs with DIAL RAG to allow users to search the web and their own documents. DIAL Web RAG is an example of a stand-alone DIAL application that leverages another application -- in this case, DIAL RAG. Web RAG retrieves the most relevant results from Cloud Search APIs and runs them through DIAL RAG to pass the LLM additional context for summarization.
