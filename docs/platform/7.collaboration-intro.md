# Collaboration in DIAL

## Overview

DIAL can serve as a collaborative and knowledge-sharing platform for the entire organization. To facilitate this, we provide a variety of features accessible through both the API and the chat user interface.

In DIAL, we use the concept of [resources](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/1.concepts.md): refers to conversations, prompts, files, and applications.

* Publication: you can publish resources making them accessible to the selected audience in your organization.
* Sharing: you can share your resources with a specific user with or without [re-share permissions](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/1.work-with-resources/1.sharing.md#re-sharing).
* Notifications: you can receive notifications when specific events occur. For example, your publication request has been approved.

## Publication

You can use [DIAL UI](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#publications) and [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications) to publish/unpublish conversations, prompts (or even a collection of those) and applications, making them accessible within your organization. Additionally, you can manage access to the published resources, ensuring that a particular resource is accessible to the authorized individuals or teams. 

When a resource is published, it becomes available in DIAL Chat and [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md), where users (with user roles that have access) can discover and utilize it.

## Sharing

In DIAL, when a resource is created or uploaded from an external source, it is stored in a dedicated [storage bucket](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/1.concepts.md#persistent-layer). 

You can use [DIAL UI](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#share-app) and [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing) to share these resources with other users or applications. A shared resource becomes available for a recipient(s) in DIAL Chat, [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md) and via API.

##### READ and WRITE Permissions

Use READ permission to allow a recipient to view/use the shared resource. You can use sharing to collaborate in real time by giving WRITE access to your resources. 

##### SHARE Permissions

You can share a resource with [re-share permissions](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/1.work-with-resources/1.sharing.md#re-sharing), allowing a recipient to share a resource with other users.

> * Refer to [Conversations](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#share), [Prompts](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#share-1), [Applications](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#share-app) to see how DIAL Chat users can work with sharing.
> * Refer to [Sharing](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/1.work-with-resources/1.sharing.md) to see development tutorials.
> * Refer to [Sharing API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing) to see sharing endpoints.

## Notification

DIAL API support two slightly different types of notifications: notifications and subscribe. Notifications are user to notify about specific actions, e.g. when a publication request is approved. Subscriptions allows receiving notifications about changes such as DELETE, CREATE, UPDATE made to DIAL resources such as applications, files, conversations and prompts.

> * Refer to [Notifications](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/1.work-with-resources/2.notifications.md) to see development tutorials.
> * Refer to [Notifications API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Notifications).

## Moderated Publications

Only resources verified and approved by [administrators](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#administrators) get published to ensure security and safety for all users.
