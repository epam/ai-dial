# Collaboration in DIAL

## Overview

DIAL can serve as a collaborative and knowledge-sharing platform for the entire organization, where you can create resources such as applications or tools, collaborate with other users on their development, and expose them, when ready to the entire organization on DIAL Marketplace. 

The principle of collaboration rests upon the DIAL's approach to access control which enables users to access resources of other users. 

[DIAL Core](/docs/platform/3.core/0.about-core.md) operates with resources or we can also call them objects. These are applications, conversations, prompts, files and toolsets. DIAL users can add these resource to DIAL and keep them to themselves, we call it a private space. Or, they can enable other users to access these resources based on predefined access rules.

> Refer to [Access Control](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/6.access-control.md) to learn more about DIAL's approach to access control, private and public spaces.

To enable collaboration, DIAL includes features accessible through both the [DIAL Core API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) and the [DIAL Chat user interface](/docs/platform/4.chat/0.about-chat.md).

* [Publication](#publication): DIAL users can publish their private resources to make them accessible to all users or the selected audience.
* [Sharing](#sharing): DIAL users can give access to their private resources to selected users without exposing them to the entire organization.

## Publication

Publications are a great way to make your applications, agents, prompts, toolsets or conversations available to a wide audience. The basic principle behind publication, is that published resources become accessible from a Public space, where all DIAL users or a selected groups of users can access them and they can be managed by DIAL administrators. For example, you can publish an application that you have created to make it available to all users in your organization and continue working in your private space on the next version of it, without affecting the published version.

DIAL users can make a request via both [DIAL Chat UI](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#publications) and [DIAL Core API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications) to publish conversations, prompts, applications or toolsets. When making a publication request, you can add publication rules to limit the audience who can access the published resources. 

Each publication request goes through an approval process by [administrators](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md) to ensure security and safety for all users.

Published conversations and prompts become available to all DIAL Chat users. Published applications and toolsets are exposed on [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md), making it a collaboration hub for the organization.

## Sharing

In cases, when resource owners want to enable access to specific resources without making them public, they can create a sharing link and give it to specific users. This way other users get access to the resource but the resource itself stays in the private space of the resource owner who can modify it or withdraw access at any time.

Sharing is a great way to expose your resources to other users while keeping control over it. For example, you can share a conversation with a colleague to get feedback on it or share an application you developed with a team member to test it.

Additionally, a sharing link can give editing and re-sharing permissions to the recipient. It is a great way to collaborate with other users in real time, for example on developing applications like [Code Apps](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#code-apps). To track changes, DIAL Core includes an [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Notifications/operation/subscribeToResources) to receive notifications when a resource is modified.

DIAL users can create a sharing link via both [DIAL Chat UI](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#share-app) and [DIAL Core API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing). 

When a resource is shared, it becomes available for a recipient(s) in DIAL Chat, [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md) and via DIAL Core API.
