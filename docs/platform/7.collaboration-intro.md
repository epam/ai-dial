# Collaboration in DIAL

## Overview

DIAL can serve as a collaborative and knowledge-sharing platform for the entire organization. To facilitate this, we provide a variety of features accessible through both the API and the chat user interface.

In DIAL, we use the concept of [resources](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/1.concepts.md): refers to conversations, prompts, files, and applications.

* Publication: you can publish resources making them accessible to the selected audience in your organization.
* Sharing: you can share your resources with a specific person.
* Notifications: you can receive notifications when specific events occur. For example, your publication request has been approved.

> Watch a [demo video](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/3.dial-collaboration.md) to see collaboration features in action.

## Publication

You can publish/unpublish conversations, prompts (or even a collection of those) and applications, making them accessible within your organization. Additionally, you can manage access to the published resources, ensuring that a particular resource is accessible to the authorized individuals or teams.

## Sharing

In DIAL, when a resource is created or uploaded from an external source, it is stored in a dedicated [storage bucket](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/1.concepts.md#persistent-layer). You can share these resources with other users or applications. The sharing functionality is available through both the DIAL API and the DIAL Chat UI. Collaborate in real time by sharing access to your applications, with options to grant editing rights or use-only permissions.

## Notification

DIAL API support two slightly different types of notifications: notifications and subscribe. Notifications are user to notify about specific actions, e.g. when a publication request is approved. Subscriptions allows receiving notifications about changes such as DELETE, CREATE, UPDATE made to DIAL resources such as applications, files, conversations and prompts.
