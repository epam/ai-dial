# DIAL Marketplace

## Introduction

> Watch a [demo video](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/2.marketplace.md) to explore DIAL Marketplace.

[DIAL Marketplace](https://dialx.ai/marketplace) is a single-entry point for all applications, agents, tools, and models available in the DIAL environment of your organization. 

> For a detailed understanding of all that DIAL Marketplace has to offer, please refer to our [User Guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#marketplace).

On DIAL Marketplace, users can find all agents (apps and models) available in their organization based individual roles. Organizations can leverage DIAL Marketplace to host and manage all their GenAI assets in one place and also to create collaboration and development power house.

## Collaboration Center

Marketplace includes collaboration features. You can [share your](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#share-app) apps with colleagues and grant editing rights or use-only permissions. 

You can also [publish your applications](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#publish-app) to make them available to a wide audience, all within the permission model of your organization.

For safety purposes only apps verified and approved by administrators get published.

## Development Studio

DIAL Marketplace can also serve as a development studio, with its [low and no-code wizards](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#application-builder) to create applications.
