# DIAL-Native Applications

## Introduction

DIAL-native applications adhere to the [unified protocol](/docs/platform/3.core/0.about-core.md#unified-api) of DIAL, a single protocol for all applications and models deployed in a specific DIAL instance. DIAL-native apps can be enabled in DIAL and used directly (via API or UI) or as building blocks in other apps.

## Schema-rich Applications

DIAL-native applications can be schema-rich.

Schema-rich applications are defined by a JSON schema that conforms to the main [meta schema](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core/blob/development/config/src/main/resources/custom-application-schemas/schema.json). JSON schema describes the application's structure, including properties and endpoints (completion, configuration, and other), URLs for application editor (enabling a UI wizard for creating/editing applications) and custom application UI to replace the standard chat UI, [custom buttons](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/1.custom-buttons.md).

Users can create instances of schema-rich applications with different properties via [DIAL Core API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Applications/operation/saveCustomApplication). There is a method in [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk) (`application_properties = await request.request_dial_application_properties()`) that returns application properties with a configuration request to DIAL Core.

**Application Runners** are used to run schema-rich applications. An application runner can be seen as an application factory that allows end-users create individual logical instances each with its own configuration. An application runner definition includes a configuration schema that enforces data structure persisted for each instance. It is worth noting that Quick Apps, Code Apps and Mind Maps are application runners available in DIAL platform out of the box. DIAL admins can add and manage runners in the [DIAL Admin application](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/builders-application-runners.md).

Unlike [apps without schemas](#standalone-applications), where business logic properties are embedded in the application code or container environment and are difficult to change, schema-rich applications provide greater flexibility.

### Application Types

Schema-rich applications are usually associated with a specific **Application Type** - as schema-rich template for creating custom implementations of specific application types.

The [meta schema](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core/blob/development/config/src/main/resources/custom-application-schemas/schema.json) determines a possible structure of an application type schema, which is used to determine properties structure of specific applications of this type:

One of the main advantages of application types, is that they allow adding [application wizards](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#application-builder) on UI for end-users to create/edit apps in a low and no-code manner via a UI editor.

Out of the box, DIAL includes application types such as Quick app, Code app and Mind Map. Users of DIAL Chat can use UI wizards to create custom instances of these application types.

:floppy_disk: In self-hosted deployments of DIAL, you can add new application types, featuring custom application UI (`applicationTypeViewerUrl`) and wizards (`applicationTypeEditorUrl`) and enabling end-users to create applications of that type. Refer to [Custom Apps](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/6.develop-custom-apps-overview.md) to learn about custom applications in DIAL.


#### Quick Apps

Quick Apps is a no-code orchestrator conceptually similar to OpenAI's GPTs that simplifies the creation of multi-agent workflows. In Quick Apps, you can use AI agents, [MCP toolsets](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/mcp-tools.md), REST APIs, language models and other tools available in the DIAL ecosystem as building blocks to create applications. For example, you can create an app with a toolset allowing it to call an external API to get a real-time weather forecast for a specific location. Another example is a RAG-like application that can generate responses based on predefined sources.

> - Refer to [Quick App Configuration Guide](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/5.quick-app-configuration.md) to see configuration guidelines and a full configuration example for Quick app.

#### Quick Apps 2.0

Quick Apps 2.0 is a composer for building applications from reusable components. It gives possibility to put together task-oriented workflows from DIAL agents (DIAL-native applications and AI models) and external integrations (MCP servers), with any AI model (supporting toolsets) registered in DIAL Core acting as an agent orchestrator.

You can use Quick Apps 2.0 to create solutions similar to [DIAL ChatHub](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/3.dial-chathub.md).

> - Refer to [User Guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#quick-apps-20) to learn how to add Quick Apps 2.0 using the UI editor.

#### Code Apps

Code Apps allow you to develop, deploy and run your Python applications directly in the DIAL Chat UI. It is a useful tool if you need to quickly create an application for the POC, deploy it and share with the selected audience.

In DIAL Chat UI you can:

- Create and customize Code Apps using the built-in Python code editor directly in DIAL Chat.
- Deploy Code Apps without worrying about hosting or scalability.
- Implement essential endpoints for DIAL compatibility.
- Manage environment variables.
- Edit and publish Code Apps.

Limitations and security restrictions:

- Code Apps are deployed and maintained exclusively by DIAL platform, similarly, to handling lambda function by cloud providers.
- Code Apps do not have access to internet.
- Code Apps do not have state outside of DIAL APIs.
- You can use only Python libraries, databases, and models that are supported by DIAL.
- Code Apps cannot call each other or any external endpoints with the exception of DIAL Core, if it is allowed.
- All traffic is encrypted, and Code Apps are run in an isolated network.

> - Refer to [User Guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#add-code-app) to learn how to add Code Apps.

#### Mind Maps

Mind Map enables users to explore information through an interactive knowledge graph and using natural language. You can use this application type to create an app which pulls data from various sources, including documents, URLs, and other data inputs and then presents it on UI as an interactive knowledge graph, facilitating intuitive and engaging user interactions with information. The [home page](https://dialx.ai/) of the DIALX landing website is built using this technology.

## Standalone Applications

Standalone applications are not tied to any specific application type nor their structure is defined by a JSON schema. When enabling such an app, you must explicitly specify (in the [API PUT request](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/3.enable-app.md#using-api-1)) standard parameters of the application and available endpoints the application offers. Properties that define the logic and behavior of the application are part of the application code and the container it runs in, meaning they cannot be modified through the DIAL Core API, contrary to [schema-rich applications](#schema-rich-applications). For example, to enable two apps without schemas, you may need to launch two containers, whereas for schema-rich apps, you can make just two API calls.

## Create Applications

You can create DIAL-native applications programmatically or using UI wizards.

### Development

You can develop DIAL-native apps using [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk/blob/development/README.md) following [DIAL API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api). The unified protocol of DIAL supports tool calling, seeds, token usage, streaming and more. Refer to [DIAL Core](/docs/platform/3.core/0.about-core.md#unified-api) to learn more about unified protocol features.

### UI Wizards

[Schema-rich applications](#schema-rich-applications) can feature auto-generated or custom UI wizards allowing end-users to create apps of specific [application types](#application-types).

> - Refer to [User Guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#applications) to learn how to create applications using UI wizards.
> - Refer to [Tutorials for developers](/tutorials/developers/apps-development/enable-app#enable-schema-rich-applications) to learn how to enable schema-rich apps in DIAL.

## Enable Applications in DIAL

Ready and deployed applications must be enabled to use them in DIAL.

> Refer to [Developer Tutorials](/tutorials/developers/apps-development/enable-app) to learn how to enable DIAL-native apps.

**Prerequisites for enablement of schema-rich applications:**

- A schema of the application type must be included in the DIAL Core configuration.
- An application runner container must be running for each application type.
- These containers must be accessible via the endpoints specified in the JSON schema for their respective application types.

**Prerequisites for enablement of for applications without schemas:**

- You must have a running container with your app accessible for DIAL Core via the endpoints you provide in the PUT request.
