# Access Control

DIAL provides means for managing access to system resources (objects) and other entities (business objects) for roles (subjects).

## About Resources

Resources in DIAL are applications, models, toolsets, files, conversations and prompts. 

> * Refer to [Applications](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md) to learn about apps in DIAL.
> * Refer to [Models](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md) to learn about the supported language models in DIAL.
> * Refer to [DIAL Core](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md) to learn how to register toolsets in DIAL Core.

Resources are stored in a dedicated BLOB storage (or a local file system) and can be accessed through the [DIAL Core API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) and also via [DIAL Admin Panel](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md).

In DIAL, resources can be located in  *so-called* public or private *space*.

|Space|Description|Ownership|
|---|---|---|
|Public|All published resources and resources enabled via DIAL Core dynamic settings belong to a public folder. Public folder can include sub-folders for files, conversations, prompts etc.|By default, any user can access a public resource. Roles can limit access to public resources. When making a publication request, you can define rules (using roles) to limit the access.|
|Private|All resources enabled via API that have not been published. Private folder can include sub-folders for files, conversations, prompts.|By default, only resource owner and system admin can access private resources. Owner can share/publish a resource, providing access to other users.|

## About Roles

Roles in DIAL provide a flexible and granular mechanism for managing access, controlling resource utilization, and customizing application behavior.

* **Resource Access Control:** Roles determine who can use specific resources. For instance, you can grant users with a specific role access to the "chat-gpt-35-turbo" model.
* **Usage Limits:** Roles can enforce limits on resource usage, preventing overuse and abuse. You can set daily, weekly, or monthly token limits for specific roles using a model.
* **Custom Application Logic:** Developers can leverage roles within their applications to create custom behaviors. By accessing role information from user tokens, applications can tailor responses or restrict access to internal assets.
* **System Feature Access:** Roles manage access to system-level features, ensuring only authorized users have access. For example, only users with the "admin" role might be able to access the administration console.
* **Sharing Limits**: For a role, you can configure the maximum number of users who can accept a shared resource and the TTL of the invitation link.

> Refer to [DIAL Core repository](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-settings) to see how to add roles to the DIAL Core configuration.

### DIAL Admin Role

DIAL Admin is a special role that has full access to all system resources and features.

* Admin(s) can be defined in [DIAL Core static settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#static-settings) in the `access.admin.rules`.
* Admin controls global settings for DIAL.
* Admin has READ and WRITE access to all system resources (applications, models, toolsets, files, conversations and prompts.).
* Admin can view, approve and reject publication requests from DIAL users.
* Admin has access to all DIAL Core API endpoints.
* **Note**: Admin cannot access Application settings, can only disable/delete Application, or create a new Application (and become its Admin).

> DIAL Admin Panel is a web interface that allows DIAL Admin to manage system resources, users, and roles. Refer to [DIAL Admin Panel](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md) to learn more.

## How to Grant Access to Resources

Access to resources that are defined solely in DIAL Core dynamic settings and those that are enabled using API and UI are managed differently.

### Access to resources defined in DIAL Core dynamic settings

Resources defined in DIAL Core dynamic setting can be seen as if they are a part of the public space from the beginning. 

**IMPORTANT**: It is not possible to share or publish such resources for other users.

There are several ways to control access to such resources:

* DIAL Admin can access resources that are defined in DIAL Core dynamic settings (e.g. applications, models, toolsets) via [DIAL Admin Panel](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md). 
* It is also possible to enable access to them by creating and assigning roles for JWT and API keys using `userRoles` property in DIAL Core dynamic settings. In DIAL Core dynamic settings, you can also define limits to control the usage of resources. 

    **IMPORTANT**: If roles are not assigned, such resources are available to everyone.

> Refer to [Roles](#about-roles) to learn more and to tutorials to learn how to assign roles to [API keys](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/1.api-key-roles.md) and [JWT](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.chat-users-roles.md).

### Access to resources defined using API and UI

Resources enabled via API or UI are stored in a dedicated storage of a related user. DIAL provides several ways to grant access to such resources: 

* **Sharing**: Resource owners can share resources with other users and provide READ or WRITE permissions. Refer to [Sharing](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/1.work-with-resources/1.sharing.md) to learn more.
* **Publications**: Resource owners can publish resources to the *public space*, making them accessible to all users. When making a publication request, it is possible to select roles that will have access. Refer to [Publications](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/1.work-with-resources/0.work-with-publications.md) to learn more.

### Grant Access to API Keys

API keys, combined with roles and configuration settings, provide a mechanism for managing how applications and services interact with your resources. 

Here's how it works:

**Configuration and Management:** The `aidial.config.json` file in DIAL Core is where you define API keys, their roles, and the associated access limitations. This centralized configuration allows for granular management of API access and resource utilization.

> Refer to [DIAL Core](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core/blob/development/sample/aidial.config.json) to view configuration examples.

**Role-Based Access:** API keys are assigned specific roles, which dictate the resources they can access. These roles are linked to system resources like applications, models, toolsets, files, conversations and prompts.

**Defining Access and Restrictions:** You create an API key and assign it a role (e.g., "user"). Then, you define the permissions and limitations associated with that role. For example, the "user" role might grant access to the "chat-gpt-35-turbo" model but with specific usage limits (tokens per minute, day, etc.).

> Refer to [Roles and Access Control for API Keys](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/1.api-key-roles.md) to learn how to configure roles and limits for API keys.

### Grant Access to JWT

DIAL allows you to control how chat users access system resources. This is achieved by integrating with your existing identity service provider (IDP) and using roles for granular access management. 

**IDP Integration:** DIAL connects with your IDP (e.g., Azure Active Directory) to manage users and groups. You define user roles and groups within your IDP, which are then passed to DIAL Core through JWT (JSON Web Token). Refer to [Configure IDPs Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/3.configure-idps/0.overview.md) to learn what IDPs are supported and how to configure this integration.

**Role-Based Access Control:** In the DIAL Core configuration, you specify which user roles from your IDP have access to specific resources (applications, models, toolsets, files, conversations and prompts). For example, you can grant the "operator" role access to the "chat-gpt-35-turbo" model. Refer to [JWT Roles & Limits](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.chat-users-roles.md) to learn how to configure roles.

**Usage Limits by Role:** You can define usage limits for each role to prevent resource overuse. This could involve setting limits on tokens per minute, day, or month for a specific model. Refer to [JWT Roles & Limits](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.chat-users-roles.md#add-limits) to learn how to configure limits for roles.
