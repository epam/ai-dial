# Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity. 

There are two supported methods to authorize AI DIAL Core API calls: JSON Web Token (JWT) and API key. Both options provide granular permission management, allowing you to control access to specific functionalities or resources. Additionally, these authorization methods also enable rate and cost control, giving you the ability to manage the frequency of API calls.

## API Keys

AI DIAL utilizes API keys for server-to-server authentication. They are defined and stored in the configuration file of AI DIAL Core. By associating API keys with roles, you can control which resources they can access and set limits on their usage. This ensures secure and controlled access to your AI DIAL resources programmatically.

> Refer to tutorials to learn how to [Create API Keys](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/0.programmatic-auth.md) and configure [Roles and Limits](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/1.API Key Roles.md) to enable access control.

## JWT

JSON Web Token (JWT) is used for Authenticationentication to securely transmit information between a client and a server as a JSON object. When a user logs in, the identity service provider validates the credentials and returns a signed JWT to AI DIAL chat back-end. This JWT contains information about the user's identity. AI DIAL, allows to use various Identity Service Providers (IDPs) to manage user identities.
