# DIAL Core

## Introduction

> * Refer to [DIAL Core](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core) GitHub repository to view the project source code and configuration guidelines.
> * Refer to [DIAL Components](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/3.components.md#ai-dial-core) to view the DIAL Core overview.

**DIAL Core** serves as the primary system component, acting as a **main integration center**, that employs a **Unified Protocol** ([OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference) compatible) for communication between internal and external clients, including LLM models, Applications, and other to access all its features in a governed and unified manner.

DIAL Core is headless and is the **only mandatory component**. It includes all the key platform features:

## Unified API

DIAL provides a single Unified API, based on OpenAI API, for accessing all language models, embedding models and applications. The key design principle is to create a unification layer that allows all models and applications to be interchangeable, delivering a cohesive conversational experience and future-proof development of custom GenAI applications.

> Watch a [Video Demo](/docs/video%20demos/3.Developers/3.dial-unified-api.md) about the unified protocol of DIAL.

### Unified API Features

* Streaming
* Token usage (even in the streaming mode)
* Seeds: helps to achieve deterministic results for LLM responses.
* Tools: (formerly known as functions) are specialized utilities that streamline development by implementing standardized methods for LLMs to access external APIs.
* Multi-modality: allows supporting non-textual communications such as image-to-text, text-to-image, file transfers and more.
* Compatibility with OpenAI

This approach streamlines communication and fosters interoperability by eliminating the need for multiple protocols for each integration.
