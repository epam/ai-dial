#### Infrastructure

AI DIAL is an enterprise-grade, open-source platform designed for flexibility and scalability. Its cloud-agnostic architecture empowers you to deploy on your preferred cloud platform — be it Microsoft Azure, AWS, GCP, or any other — or even on-premises. This freedom extends to hardware choices as well, allowing you to run AI DIAL on anything from a personal laptop to a full-fledged Minikube cluster.

Our commitment to openness means AI DIAL isn't tied to any specific vendor's products or services. You have the freedom to choose the infrastructure and tools that best suit your business needs, without vendor lock-in. 

> In [DIAL Helm](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm) you find stable assemblies of Helm charts.

#### Installation Requirements

Despite its robust capabilities, AI DIAL requires only a few basic resources: Kubernetes for orchestration, BLOB storage for data, a Secret Manager for security, Log Analytics for monitoring, an Identity Provider for authentication, and of course, your choice of LLMs (Large Language Models). 

AI DIAL minimizes technical complexity and licensing risks by leveraging community hardware, cost-effective storage solutions, and open technologies.  The system operates with minimal resource requirements, running smoothly on both powerful cloud infrastructures and personal laptops.

#### Storage

Data portability is paramount. AI DIAL stores all user data in BLOB storage, simplifying cloud-to-cloud migrations. Furthermore, its decentralized design eliminates the need for a centralized database, relying instead on Redis and cloud storage solutions. This approach makes AI DIAL an ideal platform for building web-scale solutions.
