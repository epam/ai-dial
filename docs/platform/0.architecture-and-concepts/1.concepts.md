# Main Concepts and Definitions

## Unified API

[DIAL Unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api), based on OpenAI API, gives access to all language and embedding models and applications. It helps create a unification layer where all models and applications are interchangeable, delivering a cohesive conversational experience and future-proof development of GenAI applications.

Compatibility with OpenAI, makes it simple to add new adapters for language models or develop them with DIAL SDK.

> - Watch a [video demo](/docs/video%20demos/3.Developers/3.dial-unified-api.md).

## Application Server

DIAL acts as application server offering tools to develop, deploy, host and manage different types of GenAI applications while handling scalability, availability, security and resource optimization tasks.

## Agents

Agents in DIAL, are all [available language models](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md) and [DIAL-native applications](#dial-native-applications). DIAL can serve as an agentic platform, where you can use any agent as building block to create powerful multi-agent and multi-modal applications.

You can create agents using [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk/blob/development/README.md) and [DIAL API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api), or no-code and low-code [application wizards](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#application-builder).

When ready, you can list your agents in [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md) and enable others to use them or even contribute to the development.

> Refer to [Agentic Platform](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md) to learn more.

## DIAL-Native Applications

DIAL-native apps have API that adheres to [Unified API of DIAL](https://dialx.ai/dial_api). You can use your apps as agents in DIAL seamlessly if they meet this requirement.

Yo can create DIAL-native apps using [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk/blob/development/README.md) and also no-code and low-code [application wizards](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#application-builder)

> Refer to [DIAL-Native Apps](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md) to learn how to create DIAL-native apps.

## Resources

In DIAL, resources refer to applications, conversations, prompts, and files. When added to the system, these resources are stored in a dedicated folder within a BLOB storage account bucket assigned to your user account. Resources can be managed using a consistent pattern, including CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), publishing, sharing, and other actions.

> - In [DIAL API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) you can find dedicated sections for working with resources: [applications](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Applications), [conversations](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Conversations), [prompts](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Prompts) and [files](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Files).
> - Refer to [Collaboration](/docs/platform/7.collaboration-intro.md) to learn about collaboration features such as sharing and publication that can be applied to resources.
> - Refer to [Applications](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#applications) to learn how to develop, add and manage apps in DIAL.
