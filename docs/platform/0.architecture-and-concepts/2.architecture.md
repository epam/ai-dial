# DIAL Architecture

## Introduction

DIAL has modular architecture which enables implementing custom and scalable solutions to fit specific business needs. You can have a minimal setup installed even on your personal laptop that includes only DIAL Core to get familiar with the system and build on top of it adding more components from DIAL ecosystem.

## Components

### DIAL Core

> * Refer to [DIAL Core](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core) GitHub repository to access source code and additional documentation.
> * Refer to [Core](/docs/platform/3.core/0.about-core.md) to learn more about DIAL Core and its features.
> * Refer to [DIAL Core API Reference](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) to access API documentation.

**DIAL Core** serves as the primary and the **only mandatory** system component, acting as a **main integration center**, that employs a **Unified Protocol** ([OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference) compatible) for communication between internal and external clients, including all LLM models and applications to access all its features in a governed and unified manner.

### DIAL Chat

DIAL Chat is a default user interface of the DIAL Platform. It is a powerful and highly customizable application for end-users, with enterprise-grade access control, extendable functionality and ability to add custom GenAI applications.

  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import CHATAIOverlay from "./script.js";

      const chatAiOverlay = new CHATAIOverlay("http://localhost:3000");
      chatAiOverlay.load();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Persistent Layer

DIAL architecture includes a persistent layer, that relies on a resilient and scalable cloud blob storage (you can configure either AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage or a local file storage) where all conversations, prompts, custom applications and user files will be stored. Redis Cache (either cluster or a standalone) is deployed on top of it to enhance performance.

This architecture facilitates the swift retrieval of stored resources, supporting features such as sharing and publication of conversations and prompts.

### Analytics

The DIAL Analytics Realtime tool uses diverse techniques such as embedding algorithms, clustering algorithms, frameworks, light-weight self-hosted language models, to analyze the conversation data and extract the needed results, which can be presented in tools such as Grafana for visualization.

> * Refer to [Analytics Realtime](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-analytics-realtime) GitHub repository.
> * Refer to [Tutorials](/docs/platform/6.realtime-analytics-intro.md) to learn more about configuration and usage of this service.

Analytics Realtime tool is a sink of `vector.dev`. It does not retain any private information, such as user prompts or conversations, beyond the system. Instead, only the computed artifacts are collected and stored in time-series databases like InfluxDB or any scalable database capable of handling voluminous, constantly changing information.

Examples of the computed artifacts:

- Who has used the AI? – user hash, title, and never personal data such as names.
- What areas have people asked questions about?
- Are there any recurring patterns?
- Topics of conversations.
- Unique users.
- Sentiments.
- Cost analysis of the communication.
- Language of conversations.
- Any other calculated statistics based on conversations.

### Model Adapters

Model Adapters unify the APIs of respective AI models to align with the Unified Protocol of DIAL Core. Each Adapter operates within a dedicated container. Multi-modality allows supporting non-textual communications such as image-to-text, text-to-image, file transfers and more.

Compatibility with [Azure OpenAI API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference), makes it simple to add new adapters for language models or develop them with [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk).

DIAL includes adapters for all major LLM providers:

* [OpenAI](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-openai)
* [Bedrock](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-bedrock/?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models)
* [Vertex](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-vertexai/?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models)

### Admin

The DIAL Admin Panel provides system administrators with powerful and intuitive UI tools to configure, manage, and monitor the DIAL ecosystem.

> Refer to [Admin Panel](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md) to learn more.

### Agent Builders

Agent Builders can be seen as *factories* that enable end users create logical instances of predefined application types with custom configurations via intuitive UI tools.

DIAL includes pre-built builders for Quick Apps, Code Apps and Mind Maps. You can use DIAL SDK to create custom application builders.

### DIAL Bot for MS Teams

Modern workplaces rely on multiple specialized tools, but constantly switching between applications disrupts workflow and reduces productivity. We recognized that users needed access to DIAL's powerful AI capabilities without leaving their primary communication environment in Microsoft Teams.

> Refer to [DIAL Integration with Microsoft Teams](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/5.integrations/4.msteams-bot.md) to learn about DIAL bot for MS Teams.

## Upstream Integrations

TBD

External clients can use DIAL API to access DIAL resources.

## Downstream Integrations

DIAL enables agents to leverage any technology of their choice that is required to execute their logic be it external data sources, vector databases, files storages, graph databases, third-party APIs and more.

> You can use [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk/blob/development/README.md) to create custom agents.

## Orchestrators

DIAL is an open-ended platform that can be easily integrated with other process automation and orchestration systems like Power Automate, n8n or AirFlow.
