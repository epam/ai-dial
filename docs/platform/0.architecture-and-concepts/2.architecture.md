## DIAL Components

DIAL Core is the only required component. A minimal installation containing only DIAL Core can run on a personal laptop, making it an accessible starting point for evaluation and development. Production deployments typically include DIAL Core, DIAL Chat, and model adapters to provide user access to multiple AI models. DIAL's modular architecture enables organizations to add components based on their specific requirements.

### DIAL Core (Only required component)

DIAL Core is the central integration hub and the **only mandatory** component of the DIAL platform. It provides an [OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference)-compatible API (Unified Protocol) that standardizes communication between clients, AI models, and applications.

> * Refer to [DIAL Core API Reference](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) to access API documentation.

### DIAL Chat

DIAL Chat is the default web-based user interface for the DIAL platform, providing a conversational interface, application marketplace, and development workspace in a single application with enterprise-grade access control, extendable functionality and ability to add custom GenAI applications.

**Key features**:

* **Conversational interface**: Interact with AI models, applications, and agents; manage conversations, prompts, and files
* **Marketplace**: Browse and access AI models, applications, and tools both private and shared across the organization
* **Application builders**: Create and configure AI applications using no-code/low-code tools (Quick Apps, Code Apps, Mind Maps)
* **Collaboration**: Share and publish conversations, prompts, and applications with users and groups
* **Customization**: Apply custom themes, logos, and branding
* **Advanced rendering**: Execute code securely and display visualizations, charts, markdown, and LaTeX
* **Extensibility**: Support for custom application interfaces, including non-conversational

> Refer to [Chat Overlay Documentation](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-chat/blob/development/libs/overlay/README.md) for integration examples and configuration options.

### Analytics

DIAL Analytics Realtime processes conversation data from the platform to generate usage insights and operational metrics without storing sensitive user information. The tool applies embedding algorithms, clustering techniques, and lightweight language models to analyze conversation patterns and extract statistical summaries.

**Privacy-preserving architecture**: Analytics Realtime operates as a data sink for Vector (an open-source observability data pipeline) and processes conversation data in real-time without persisting user prompts, responses, or personally identifiable information. Only computed statistical artifacts are stored in time-series databases such as InfluxDB for analysis and visualization.

**Available metrics and insights**:

* **User analytics**: Anonymized user activity (hashed identifiers only, no personal data)
* **Topic analysis**: Subject matter categorization of conversations
* **Pattern detection**: Identification of recurring themes and usage patterns
* **Sentiment analysis**: Emotional tone classification of interactions
* **Cost tracking**: Token usage and associated costs per model/application
* **Language detection**: Conversation language distribution
* **Unique user counts**: Active user statistics over time periods
* Any other calculated statistics based on conversations.

Analytics results can be visualized using standard observability platforms such as Grafana, enabling administrators to monitor platform usage, identify trends, and optimize resource allocation.

> * Refer to [DIAL Analytics Realtime](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-analytics-realtime) GitHub repository for implementation details.
> * Refer to [Analytics Configuration and Usage](/docs/platform/6.realtime-analytics-intro.md) to learn more about configuration and usage of this service.

### Model Adapters

DIAL AI Model Adapters translate provider-specific AI model APIs into DIAL's OpenAI-compatible unified protocol. This normalization allows applications to interact with any AI model through a consistent interface, regardless of the underlying provider's native API format.

DIAL includes adapters for major LLM providers:

* [OpenAI](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-openai)
* [AWS Bedrock](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-bedrock/?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models)
* [Google Vertex AI](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-vertexai/?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models)

Organizations can develop custom adapters using the DIAL SDK to integrate additional AI model providers or proprietary models.

> Refer to [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk) for adapter development documentation and examples.

### Admin

The DIAL Admin Panel provides system administrators with web-based tools to configure, manage, and monitor the DIAL platform, including but not limited to:

* **Model and application management**: Add and configure AI models, applications, and toolsets. 
* **Deployment management**: Deploy and manage Docker images for AI model adapters, interceptors and MCP servers. Deploy model servings.
* **Access control**: Define role-based permissions and manage file access policies.
* **Publication workflow**: Review and approve user requests to publish applications and toolsets.
* **System monitoring**: Track platform health, resource usage, and user activity at both deployment (e.g. application or AI model) and system levels.
* **Configuration management**: Set system-wide policies, rate limits, and operational parameters.

> Refer to [Admin Panel](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md) for detailed documentation on its features.

### Agent Builders

Agent Builders can be seen as *factories* that enable end users to create customized AI applications from predefined templates without writing code. Users configure application parameters through a UI-based workflow, then deploy and share the resulting applications with other users and groups.

For example, a custom RAG application builder may allow an end user to configure a personalized RAG agent by connecting it to chosen data sources, such as internal knowledge bases, document repositories, or external APIs. The resulting RAG application becomes available as a reusable resource that can be invoked by other users with appropriate permissions.

DIAL includes pre-built builders for Quick Apps, Code Apps and Mind Maps. Organizations can develop custom builders using the DIAL SDK to create domain-specific application templates tailored to their use cases.

> Refer to [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk/blob/development/README.md) to learn about creating custom application builders.

### DIAL Bot for MS Teams

DIAL provides a Microsoft Teams bot that enables users to securely access DIAL AI models and applications directly within the MS Teams interface. The bot eliminates the need to switch between applications, allowing users to interact with AI capabilities in their existing collaboration environment.

Through the Teams bot, users can:

* Users can access DIAL models and tools directly within MS Teams conversations
* The bot gives access to selected DIAL features including AI model selection, conversation management, and playback
* Access conversations, prompts, files stored in DIAL
* Share AI-generated output with colleagues

The bot authenticates using the organization's configured identity provider and respects the same access control policies as other DIAL clients.

> Refer to [DIAL Integration with Microsoft Teams](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/5.integrations/4.msteams-bot.md) for implementation highlights.

## External Components

### AI Models

DIAL provides access to AI models from multiple sources:

* **Major LLM providers**: Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and other commercial providers
* **Open-source models**: Models from the open-source community, including those hosted on Hugging Face
* **Self-hosted models**: Custom or fine-tuned models deployed in your own infrastructure
* **Specialized platforms**: Models from NVIDIA NIM, DeepSeek, and other AI model platforms

DIAL AI model adapters normalize the APIs of different AI providers to DIAL's unified protocol, enabling applications to access any configured model through a consistent interface regardless of its source. DIAL includes [adapters](#model-adapters) for major vendors and provides SDK to create custom adapters.

> Refer to [Supported Models](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md) for the complete list of available models.

### Identity Providers

DIAL provides native support for [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) and [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) authentication protocols, enabling integration with enterprise identity providers (IDPs). Organizations can configure their preferred IDP to manage user authentication, define roles and attributes, and implement custom access control policies.

DIAL supports integration with major identity providers:

* [AWS Cognito](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/cognito.md)
* [Auth0](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/auth0.md)
* [Google Identity](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/google.md)
* [Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/entraID.md)
* [Okta](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/okta.md)

For organizations requiring additional IDP options or more complex identity management scenarios, DIAL can integrate with [Keycloak](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/keycloak.md), which acts as an identity broker supporting a broader range of authentication providers and protocols.

> Refer to [Identity Provider Configuration Overview](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/0.overview.md) for guidance on selecting and configuring identity providers.

### MCP Servers

DIAL integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to extend AI application capabilities with external tools and data sources. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how AI applications connect to external services, enabling applications to access functionality beyond their core language model capabilities.

DIAL supports two integration approaches:

* **External MCP servers**: Connect DIAL toolsets to existing MCP servers hosted outside the platform and use them as tools to perform specific actions in agentic workflows such as querying databases, accessing APIs, reading files, or executing specialized computations through standardized MCP interfaces
* **Custom MCP server deployment**: Deploy and manage custom MCP servers as Docker containers through DIAL Admin

> * Refer to [Admin](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/deployments-mcp.md) to learn how to deploy and use custom MCP Servers via Docker images.
> * Refer to [DIAL Chat User Guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#toolsets) to learn how end users can add custom toolsets leveraging external MCP servers.
> * Refer to [DIAL Core API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Toolsets) to discover documentation for programmatic usage of toolsets.

### Security Platforms

DIAL supports custom interceptors that integrate with external AI security platforms (Google Model Armor, Presidio, Bert, Hugging Face and more) to process requests and responses flowing through the system.

Interceptors operate at the DIAL Core level, analyzing traffic before it reaches AI models/applications (incoming requests) and before responses return to users (outgoing responses).

Interceptors enable security capabilities such as:

* **PII detection and redaction**: Identify and mask personally identifiable information
* **Content filtering**: Block inappropriate, harmful, or policy-violating content
* **Prompt injection detection**: Identify potential security threats in user inputs
* **Compliance enforcement**: Apply organizational policies and regulatory requirements

Organizations can develop custom interceptors using the DIAL Interceptors SDK to integrate their preferred AI security solutions.

> * Refer to [Interceptors](/docs/platform/3.core/6.interceptors.md) to learn more.
> * Refer to [Interceptors SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-interceptors-sdk) GitHub repository to access examples and documentation.

### Upstream and Downstream Integrations

DIAL exposes an OpenAI-compatible API that external clients can use to programmatically access AI models, applications, and platform resources. 

DIAL applications can integrate with external systems and data sources required for their execution logic. Applications built with DIAL SDK can connect to:

* Data sources: Relational databases, data warehouses, REST APIs
* Vector databases: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, ChromaDB for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
* File storage: Cloud storage services, document management systems
* Graph databases: Neo4j, Neptune for knowledge graph operations
* Third-party APIs: Weather services, payment gateways, enterprise systems, and other external services

> You can use [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk/blob/development/README.md) to create custom applications.

DIAL architecture includes a persistent layer, that relies on a resilient and scalable cloud blob storage (you can configure either AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage or a local file storage) where all conversations, prompts, custom applications and user files will be stored. Redis Cache (either cluster or a standalone) is deployed on top of it to enhance retrieval performance.

![](./img/persistant-layer.svg)

This architecture facilitates swift retrieval, sharing and publication of stored objects.

### Orchestrators

DIAL can be integrated with workflow orchestration and process automation platforms to incorporate AI capabilities into multi-step business processes. OpenAI compatibility of DIAL API enables orchestrators like Power Automate, n8n, and Airflow to access AI models and applications as part of automated workflows.

> Refer to [Integration of DIAL with n8n](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/5.integrations/3.n8n-integration.md) to learn how DIAL can be integrated with n8n via a custom node.

### Observability

DIAL leverages OpenTelemetry (OTEL) to provide comprehensive system observability across all platform components. OpenTelemetry is a vendor-agnostic framework for collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data including metrics, logs, and distributed traces.

DIAL empowers you with:

* **Unified observability**: Collect metrics, logs, and traces from all DIAL components through a single standardized framework.
* **Backend flexibility**: Export telemetry data to any OTEL-compatible observability platform without vendor lock-in.
* **System insights**: Analyze collected metrics and traces to monitor system behavior and identify performance bottlenecks.
* **Standardized instrumentation**: Leverage OpenTelemetry's established standards for consistent telemetry data collection across the platform.

> Refer to [Observability and Monitoring](/docs/platform/8.observability-intro.md) to learn more.
