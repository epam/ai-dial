## DIAL Components

DIAL's modular design lets you start small and scale as needed. The only required component is DIAL Core—you can run a minimal setup on your laptop to try out the platform and understand how it works. When you're ready for production, you'll typically add DIAL Chat for the user interface and model adapters to connect to your AI models. 

### DIAL Core (required)

DIAL Core is the central integration hub and the **only mandatory** component of the DIAL platform. DIAL Core seamlessly integrates with all your GenAI applications and agents, regardless of their original platform.

**Key features**:

* [Unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api): A single and [OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference)-compatible API that standardizes communication between clients, AI models, and applications enabling unified, secure and governed access to platform tools and features
* [LLM Gateway](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md): A unified gateway to language and embedding models from all major and alternative vendors
* [Load Balancing](/docs/platform/3.core/5.load-balancer.md): Intelligent algorithms enabling creation of custom and flexible mechanisms of load distribution across model deployments, regions, and cloud subscriptions
* [Auth](/docs/platform/3.core/1.auth-intro.md): Enables centralized attribute and role-based access control to all resources with granular permission management
* [Cost Management](/docs/platform/3.core/8.token-limits-and-cost-control.md): DIAL Core enables comprehensive usage and cost control by allowing configuration of token usage, request limits, and monetary costs—customizable for individual users, groups, or API keys
* [Interceptors](/docs/platform/3.core/6.interceptors.md): Add custom logic to in/out requests for models and apps, enabling PII obfuscation, guardrails, safety checks, and beyond
* [Observability](/docs/platform/8.observability-intro.md): DIAL leverages OpenTelemetry (OTEL) to provide comprehensive system observability with a vendor-agnostic approach to collecting and analyzing telemetry data 

Minimizing technical footprint and dependence on specific vendors, DIAL architecture includes a persistent layer, that relies on a resilient and scalable cloud blob storage (you can configure either AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage or a local file storage) where all conversations, prompts, custom applications and user files will be stored. Redis Cache (either cluster or a standalone) is deployed on top of it to enhance retrieval performance. This architecture facilitates swift retrieval, sharing and publication of stored objects.

> Refer to [Admin Panel](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md) for detailed documentation on its features.

### Model Adapters

DIAL AI Model Adapters translate provider-specific AI model APIs into DIAL's OpenAI-compatible unified protocol. This normalization allows applications to interact with any AI model through a consistent interface, regardless of the underlying provider's native API format.

**DIAL includes adapters for major LLM providers**:

* [OpenAI](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-openai)
* [AWS Bedrock](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-bedrock/?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models)
* [Google Vertex AI](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-vertexai/?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models)

Organizations can develop custom adapters using the DIAL SDK to integrate additional AI model providers or proprietary models.

> Refer to [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk) for adapter development documentation and examples.

### Agent Builders

Agent Builders (technical name application runners) can be seen as *factories* that enable end users to create customized AI applications from predefined templates without writing code. Users configure application parameters through a UI-based workflow, then deploy and share the resulting applications with other users and groups.

For example, a custom RAG application builder may allow an end user to configure a personalized RAG agent by connecting it to chosen data sources, such as internal knowledge bases, document repositories, or external APIs. The resulting RAG application becomes available as a reusable resource that can be invoked by other users with appropriate permissions.

**Standard application runners**: 

DIAL includes pre-built application runners:

* [Quick Apps](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#quick-apps): No-code agents’ orchestrator conceptually similar to OpenAI's GPTs that streamlines the creation of multi-agent workflows via no-code UI editors.
* [Code Apps](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#code-apps): Code Apps allow you to develop, deploy and run Python applications directly in the DIAL Chat UI in a safe environment.  
* [Mind Maps](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#mind-maps): DIAL Mind Maps enable deterministic information discovery and research through visual, interactive knowledge graphs built from your trusted sources.

**Custom application runners**: 

Organizations can develop **custom application runners** using the DIAL SDK to create domain-specific application templates tailored to their use cases.

> Refer to [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk/blob/development/README.md) to learn about creating custom application builders.

### Analytics

DIAL Analytics Realtime processes chat completion logs to extract and analyze usage insights and operational metrics without storing sensitive user information. The tool applies embedding algorithms, clustering techniques, and lightweight language models to analyze conversation patterns and extract statistical summaries.

**Privacy-preserving architecture**: Analytics Realtime operates as a data sink for Vector (an open-source observability data pipeline) and processes conversation data in real-time without persisting user prompts, responses, or personally identifiable information. Only computed statistical artifacts are stored in time-series databases such as InfluxDB for analysis and visualization.

**Available metrics and insights**:

* **User analytics**: Anonymized user activity (hashed identifiers only, no personal data)
* **Topic analysis**: Subject matter categorization of conversations
* **Pattern detection**: Identification of recurring themes and usage patterns
* **Sentiment analysis**: Emotional tone classification of interactions
* **Cost tracking**: Token usage and associated costs per model/application
* **Language detection**: Conversation language distribution
* **Unique user counts**: Active user statistics over time periods
* Any other calculated statistics based on conversations.

Analytics results can be visualized using standard observability platforms such as Grafana, enabling administrators to monitor platform usage, identify trends, and optimize resource allocation.

> * Refer to [DIAL Analytics Realtime](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-analytics-realtime) GitHub repository for implementation details.
> * Refer to [Analytics Configuration and Usage](/docs/platform/6.realtime-analytics-intro.md) to learn more about configuration and usage of this service.

### DIAL Bot for MS Teams

DIAL provides a Microsoft Teams bot that enables users to securely access DIAL AI models and applications directly within the MS Teams interface. The bot eliminates the need to switch between applications, allowing users to interact with AI capabilities in their existing collaboration environment.

## External Components

DIAL is an open platform designed to avoid vendor lock-in, enabling seamless integration with external GenAI applications, other AI-enabling systems, custom libraries and frameworks on any cloud or chosen environment.

Being an orchestration platform, DIAL works alongside other AI-enabling systems to augment and expand their functionality.

### AI Models

DIAL provides access to AI models from multiple sources:

* **Major LLM providers**: Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and other commercial providers
* **Open-source models**: Models from the open-source community, including those hosted on Hugging Face
* **Self-hosted models**: Custom or fine-tuned models deployed in your own infrastructure
* **Specialized platforms**: Models from NVIDIA NIM, DeepSeek, and other AI model platforms

DIAL AI model adapters normalize the APIs of different AI providers to DIAL's unified protocol, enabling applications to access any configured model through a consistent interface regardless of its source. DIAL includes [adapters](#model-adapters) for major vendors and provides SDK to create custom adapters.

> Refer to [Supported Models](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md) for the complete list of available models.

### Identity Providers

DIAL provides native support for [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) and [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) authentication protocols, enabling integration with enterprise identity providers (IDPs). Organizations can configure their preferred IDP to manage user authentication, define roles and attributes, and implement custom access control policies.

**DIAL supports integration with major identity providers**:

* [AWS Cognito](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/cognito.md)
* [Auth0](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/auth0.md)
* [Google Identity](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/google.md)
* [Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/entraID.md)
* [Okta](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/okta.md)

For organizations requiring additional IDP options or more complex identity management scenarios, DIAL can integrate with [Keycloak](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/keycloak.md), which acts as an identity broker supporting a broader range of authentication providers and protocols.

> Refer to [Identity Provider Configuration Overview](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/0.overview.md) for guidance on selecting and configuring identity providers.

### MCP Servers

DIAL integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to extend AI application capabilities with external tools and data sources. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how AI applications connect to external services, enabling applications to access functionality beyond their core language model capabilities.

**DIAL supports two integration approaches**:

* **External MCP servers**: Connect DIAL toolsets to existing MCP servers hosted outside the platform and use them as tools to perform specific actions in agentic workflows such as querying databases, accessing APIs, reading files, or executing specialized computations through standardized MCP interfaces.
* **Custom MCP server deployment**: Deploy and manage custom MCP servers as Docker containers through DIAL Admin.

> * Refer to [Admin](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/deployments-mcp.md) to learn how to deploy and use custom MCP Servers via Docker images.
> * Refer to [DIAL Chat User Guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#toolsets) to learn how end users can add custom toolsets leveraging external MCP servers.
> * Refer to [DIAL Core API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Toolsets) to discover documentation for programmatic usage of toolsets.

### Security Platforms

DIAL supports custom interceptors that integrate with external AI security platforms (Google Model Armor, Presidio, Bert, Hugging Face and more) to process requests and responses flowing through the system.

Interceptors operate at the DIAL Core level, analyzing traffic before it reaches AI models/applications (incoming requests) and before responses return to users (outgoing responses).

**Interceptors enable security capabilities such as**:

* **PII detection and redaction**: Identify and mask personally identifiable information
* **Content filtering**: Block inappropriate, harmful, or policy-violating content
* **Prompt injection detection**: Identify potential security threats in user inputs
* **Compliance enforcement**: Apply organizational policies and regulatory requirements

Organizations can develop custom interceptors using the DIAL Interceptors SDK to integrate their preferred AI security solutions.

> * Refer to [Interceptors](/docs/platform/3.core/6.interceptors.md) to learn more.
> * Refer to [Interceptors SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-interceptors-sdk) GitHub repository to access examples and documentation.

### Upstream and Downstream Integrations

DIAL exposes an OpenAI-compatible API that external clients can use to programmatically access AI models, applications, and platform resources. 

DIAL applications can integrate with external systems and data sources required for their execution logic. 

**Applications built with DIAL SDK can connect to**:

* **Data sources**: Relational databases, data warehouses, REST APIs
* **Vector databases**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, ChromaDB for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
* **File storage**: Cloud storage services, document management systems
