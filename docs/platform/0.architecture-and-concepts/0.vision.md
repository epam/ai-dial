# What is DIAL

DIAL is an acronym for Deterministic Integrator of Applications and Language Models. It is a secure, scalable and customizable enterprise-grade AI platform designed to streamline Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for GenAI applications.

Watch [introduction videos](/docs/video%20demos/0.dial-product-overview.md) to learn more.

## Main Principles

* **Open-Source**: DIAL is an open-source solution available under the permissive and free [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial/blob/main/LICENSE).
* **Low TCO**: We aim to minimize technical complexity and licensing risks by utilizing community hardware, affordable storage solutions, and technologies.
* **Vendor-Agnostic**: DIAL can operate on any cloud platform and on-prem, is model and domain agnostic enabling the highest level of flexibility.
* **API-First**: All DIAL features are available via [DIAL API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api), which empowers the development of custom extensions.
* **Scalable**: DIAL does not require a centralized DB and relies on Redis and cloud storages/file system making it an ideal platform for building web-scale businesses.
* **Modular**: Start with a basic setup and scale up to a full ecosystem as needed. Go rapidly from prototyping to fully operational production applications. Refer to [Architecture](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/2.architecture.md) for more details.
* **Small Tech Footprint**: The system requires minimum resources to operate and can run equally smoothly on clouds and personal laptops. Refer to [Stack](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/5.stack.md) to learn more.
* **Secure**: Sensitive information is stored according to the industry best practices. Scans for dependencies, vulnerabilities, and licenses are required steps in the delivery process.

## Our Vision

DIAL is designed to be cloud-agnostic, providing horizontal features that simplify interactions with various models and LLM-centric applications, as well as the development of LLM applications. We strive to avoid dependencies on specific cloud or LLM vendors, compromises on scalability or security, excessive expansion of our tech footprint, or potential licensing risks. We typically design features as APIs, which custom extensions can leverage.

The solution is domain-agnostic. We prioritize use case-agnostic generic features (such as rendering charts in the frontend based on model responses) over features that are overly specific to a single domain (like supporting medical anthologies). However, specific implementations can be built as extensions or derived works. For more information, refer to our [extension framework](https://dialx.ai/extension-framework) and [API reference](https://dialx.ai/dial_api).

DIAL is a product that is designed to **enhance** or **extend**, rather than replace or compete with:
 
- Model providers such as [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)
- Model vendors including [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude), [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/), and [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/)
- AI studios like [Azure AI Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-studio), [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/aistudio), and [Meta AI Studio](https://ai.meta.com/ai-studio/)
- Data platforms such as [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) and [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com/)
- Application development frameworks including [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) and [SemanticKernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)
- Low-code application designers like [Flowise](https://flowiseai.com/)
 
We aim to complement these services, streamlining the development, deployment, and operation of GenAI applications, as well as facilitating the [interoperability](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/2.architecture.md) of various applications to achieve specific business objectives. For this purpose we provide:
 
- [Unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) to access multimodal models, applications, and embedding models.
- Essential services such as resilient file/chat/prompt/model storage with user-based [access control](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md).
- Important operational features, including [sharing](/docs/platform/7.collaboration-intro.md), organization-wide [publications](/docs/platform/7.collaboration-intro.md#publication), [review](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#administrators) processes, and flexible [rate limits](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core/blob/development/docs/dynamic-settings/roles.md#rolesrole_namelimits) for [JWT](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/1.jwt.md) and [API keys](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/0.api-keys.md).
