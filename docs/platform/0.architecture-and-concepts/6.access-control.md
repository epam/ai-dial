# Introduction to Access Control in DIAL

## Introduction

Access control is the system that determines who (Subject) can see and use different resources (Objects) within DIAL. At its most basic level, access control answers these questions:

- Who is allowed to access a particular resource?
- What actions are they permitted to take with that resource?
- Under what conditions is access granted or denied?

In DIAL, we use access control to protect resources like models, applications, files, conversations, prompts and toolsets while ensuring that authorized Subjects can still access and work with them efficiently. It's essentially a gatekeeper that verifies a Subjects's identity and permissions before allowing them to interact with protected resources.

## Roles

DIAL provides native support for [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) and [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) and offers integration with various Identity Providers (IDP) such as [Auth0](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/3.configure-idps/auth0.md), [Okta](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/3.configure-idps/okta.md), [Microsoft Entra](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/3.configure-idps/entraID.md), [Google OAuth2](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/3.configure-idps/google.md), and [AWS Cognito](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/3.configure-idps/cognito.md) where you can define user roles and attributes to support your custom permissions model. Additionally, you can leverage [Keycloak](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/3.configure-idps/keycloak.md) to work with even wider range of IDPs.

Your user roles can be associated in DIAL with individual users, groups of users and API keys to define what actions they can perform on specific resources.

Additionally, roles in DIAL provide a flexible and granular mechanism for managing access, controlling resource utilization, and customizing application behavior:

* **Resource Access Control**: Roles determine who can use specific resources like language models or applications. For instance, you can grant "operator" users access to the "chat-gpt-35-turbo" model.
* **Usage Limits**: Roles can enforce limits on resource usage, preventing overuse and abuse. You can set daily, weekly, or monthly token limits for specific roles using a model. You can also define a global cost limits in USD for a specific role.
* **Custom Application Logic**: Developers can leverage roles within their applications to create custom behaviors. By accessing role information from user tokens, applications can tailor responses or restrict access to internal assets.
* **System Feature Access**: Roles manage access to system-level features, ensuring only authorized users have access. For example, only users with the "admin" role might be able to access the administration console.
* **Sharing Limits**: For a role, you can configure the maximum number of users who can accept a shared resource and the TTL of the invitation link.

## Managing Access Control 

In DIAL, DIAL Core is the main integration center that manages access to all protected resources or objects. In DIAL Core configuration, you can define roles and their permissions and limitations for working with various resources. 

On top of that, DIAL provides several components that interact with DIAL Core to enforce access control:

* [DIAL Core API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api): DIAL users can use API to add resources, share or publish them, explicitly defining the scope of authorized users.
* [DIAL Chat](/docs/platform/4.chat/0.about-chat.md): In DIAL Chat UI, end-users can add, share and publish their resources, explicitly defining the scope of authorized users.
* [DIAL Admin Panel](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md): A UI for system administrators, where they can manage roles and publicly available resources among other features.
