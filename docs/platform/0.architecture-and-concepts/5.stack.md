# Introduction to DIAL Technological Stack

DIAL is designed to be lightweight and efficient, requiring minimal resources to run. It primarily relies on community-driven and cost-effective solutions, helping to reduce technical complexity, avoid licensing risks, and keep the total cost of ownership (TCO) as low as possible.

> Refer to the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn more.

## Components Stack

The **only required component** is [DIAL Core](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core). Refer to [Architecture](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/2.architecture.md) to explore installation options.

- [DIAL Core](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core): Java 17, Vert.x
- [DIAL Chat](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-chat): Next.js, TypeScript
- Other system components such as Analytics Realtime, model adapters, interceptors, app builder and code interpreter: Python 3.11, FastAPI. Can bring additional stack. Refer to a [GitHub repository](https://dialx.ai/open-source) of each component to learn more.

To maintain security and compliance, all technologies used in DIAL—including Java, Python, and JavaScript libraries—are continuously monitored for security vulnerabilities and licensing issues.

## Storage

DIAL **does not require** having a centralized database. To operate, **all you need** is Redis and a storage for system and user files.

- DIAL is cloud-agnostic, meaning you can use a BLOB storage of your choice (e.g. AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) or a file system for self-hosted deployments.
- Redis is used for in-memory caching with support for write-back (write-behind) caching.

## Deployment & Observability

DIAL is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing you to deploy it on the cloud, as a self-hosted solution, or even install it on a personal laptop.

- You can quickly [launch DIAL](/docs/quick-start.md) using the container technology of your choice, such as Docker, Podman, or other containerization tools. Alternatively, you can deploy it through cloud marketplaces like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-zx4u372lqvtfi?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa), [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/epam-mp-dial/epam-ai-dial?project=forward-garden-440215-u2), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/epam-2436412.epam_dial?tab=Overview).
- For [production deployments](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/tree/main/charts/dial/examples/generic/simple), you can use Kubernetes and Helm for orchestration and management.
- DIAL supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for observability, monitoring and tracing.
- To manage secrets, DIAL integrates with popular secret management tools, including Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, and GCP Cloud Key Management.

## Authentication

DIAL provides native support for [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) and [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) and offers [integration with various Identity Providers (IDP)](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/0.overview.md) such as [AWS Cognito](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/cognito.md), [Auth0](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/auth0.md), [Google Identity](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/google.md), [Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/entraID.md), [Okta](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/okta.md) and others, where you can define user roles and attributes to support your custom permissions model. Additionally, you can leverage [Keycloak](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/2.configure-idps/keycloak.md) to work with even wider range of IDPs.
