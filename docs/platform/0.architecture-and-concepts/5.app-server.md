# DIAL as Application Server

## Introduction

DIAL Platform can serve as an application server enabling the creation of application, hosting and deployment, managing application lifecycle, and collaboration.

## Create Apps

### Develop

DIAL Platform can serve you as a development studio featuring SDK and API to develop GenAI applications. DIAL-native application can be used as building blocks, following the agentic approach, to create new applications.

When developing apps, you can leverage a technology of your preference, be it any LLM framework, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, vector DBs or any other. DIAL Core unified protocol supports MCP server calling, tool calling, streaming, multi modality and more following OpenAI API standards.

DIAL feature rich middleware (evaluation tools, observability tools,  rich collection of language models, load balancer, interceptors, RBAC, tools for managing logs and debugging apps and more) you can use out of the box to create powerful apps, focusing on your core business instead of reinventing the wheel.

DIAL Core supports the concept of application runners, offering, in a SaaS edition, several application types you can use as templates to create apps.

DIAL application types can include a UI to enable end-users to create applications using no and low-code wizard on UI.

DIAL follows an API-First approach, enabling access to all its features via a unified API.

### Test and Experiment

You can use apps in a sandbox mode to test, evaluate, edit your apps before going live. Play with various configurations, tokens usage, models, load balancing and more to optimize the performance. Prototyping, experiments, research.  Quickly build prototypes with pre-defined app types, like Code Apps, Quick Apps and Mind Map.

## Host and Deploy

Apps enables in DIAL get automatically hosted on the DIAL infrastructure, releasing you from bothering about scaling, file storage, availability, resource optimization, infrastructure security, deployment and other tasks.

Code apps allow you to deploy, version, run, manage env variables, access logs and undeploy your custom Python apps in a few clicks. 

App runners such as Mind Map and Quick Apps let you create apps using UI wizards, test, run, and publish them in a no-code manner, making them available to a wide audience in a few clicks.

## Manage and Operate

DIAL Admin allows platform administrators to manage application runners, deploy and undeploy apps from users. From their admins can monitor apps vitals, issue access credentials, revoke apps from usage, apply guardrails, control token usage policy and much more.

Apps owners can manage their applications right in the DIAL Chat Workspace, where they can edit apps, issue versions, access logs, deploy and undeploy apps, share apps with other users or publish them for a selected audience.

Admin, analytics, monitoring, logs, undeploy, version, access control, tokens limits, interceptors, revoke access, keys and roles.

Edit, deploy, undeploy apps. Issue versioning.

## Collaborate

Deploy apps can be available just for the application owner or a selected audience.

Share, unshare, re-share, publish, unpublish, access control, write access, read access

Real-time collaboration on apps development.
