# DIAL as Application Server

## Introduction

DIAL can act as an application server facilitating the development, hosting, deployment, and management of GenAI applications. 

##### Why use DIAL?

With DIAL, you not only get access to a comprehensive environment for development of GenAI applications, but also rich middleware allowing you to focus on the most important things instead of reinventing the wheel, as well as operation and collaboration tools to manage and control the entire GenAI SDLC of your applications.

## Develop

You can use DIAL Platform as a development studio, to create GenAI applications. There are two ways to do this: 

* **Developing from scratch**: You can develop an application from scratch yourself. DIAL offers [SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk) and a unified [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) to streamline the process. When developing apps, you can use a technology of your preference, be it any LLM framework, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, vector DBs or any other. Apps created with DIAL API and SDK will be compatible with the unified protocol of DIAL and can be used as [agents](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md) (building blocks) for creating multi-agent applications.
* **Using predefined application templates**: You can create applications of [Quick Apps](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#quick-apps), [Code Apps](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#code-apps), and [Mind Maps](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#mind-maps) application types using no-code and low-code UI editors or API. Application types can be seen as [schema-based templates](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#schema-rich-applications) for creating applications. You can extend the standard list of application types by creating your own to enable creation of apps with a specific logic and fully custom UI.


The platform includes a rich set of tools and features to help you build powerful and multi-agentic applications, such as:

* **[API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api)**: DIAL follows an API-First approach, enabling access to all its features via a [Unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api).
* **[SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk)**: A framework to create [applications](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md) and [model adapters](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/3.components.md#llm-adapters) for DIAL. Applications and model adapters implemented using this framework will be compatible with DIAL API that was designed based on Azure OpenAI API.
* **[Unified Protocol](/docs/platform/3.core/0.about-core.md#unified-api)**: DIAL Core unified protocol is built to be compatible with OpenAI API, which facilitates the development and integration of new applications. It is a single and unified protocol for all applications and models deployed in DIAL. It supports MCP server calling, tool calling, streaming, seeds, multi modality and more.
* **[Agents](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md#introduction)**: You can use [DIAL Unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) to call any other deployed [agent](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md#types-of-agents) (yours or created by other users based on your permissions) from your application's code. It allows reusing existing agents as components in your apps for creating multi-agent workflows faster.
* **Application Runners**: DIAL supports the concept of application runners which process parameters of specific application types. Refer to [Schema-Rich Applications](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#schema-rich-applications) for more details.
* **Experimentation and Prototyping**: Application Runners enable users to quickly [create prototypes in a no-code manner](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#application-builder) and test them before going live. [Code apps](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#code-apps) enable power users to write and run a custom Python code directly in the DIAL Chat application and deploy it on the DIAL infrastructure in a few clicks. When ready, you can publish your apps on [Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md) or [share](/docs/platform/7.collaboration-intro.md#sharing) with specific users.
* **Middleware**: DIAL includes rich middleware you can use out of the box to create powerful apps, focusing on your core business instead of reinventing the wheel:
    * [Language models](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md): DIAL supports connectivity with main LLM vendors allowing you to configure the system to fit your preferences. You can also configure access to language models from the open-source community, alternative vendors, and fine-tuned micro models, as well as self-hosted or models listed on HuggingFace or DeepSeek. 
    * [Interceptors](/docs/platform/3.core/6.interceptors.md): Interceptors enable you to add custom logic to in/out requests for models and apps, enabling PII obfuscation, guardrails, safety checks, and beyond. 
    * [RBAC](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md): DIAL supports integration with various IDPs allowing you to support your custom RBAC system.
    * [Rate Limit](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/0.programmatic-auth.md#step-3-configure-limits-optional): DIAL enables you to define adaptable rate limits for JWT and API keys to control the usage of your applications and models.
    * [Load balancer](/docs/platform/3.core/5.load-balancer.md): DIAL includes a powerful load balancer with PTU support to enable the distribution of requests to LLMs across various resources, preventing bottlenecks, enhancing fault tolerance and keeping costs under control.
    * [Observability](/docs/platform/8.observability-intro.md): Tools powered by OpenTelemetry to get the insights about your system's performance and health.
    * [Evaluation toolkit](/docs/video%20demos/3.Developers/Applications/6.dial-rag-eval.md): Evaluation toolkit is a set of tools to evaluate retrieval and generation of RAG-like applications.
    * Tools for collection and visualization of usage analytics, managing logs and debugging apps and more. 

## Host and Deploy

##### Quick apps, Code apps and Mind Maps

Applications of standard application types created based (e.g. Quick Apps, Code Apps and Mind Maps) get automatically hosted and deployed on the DIAL infrastructure. This means that you do not need to worry about the underlying infrastructure, as DIAL takes care of such tasks as hosting, scaling, file storage, and managing the applications for you.

##### Apps deployed outside DIAL

In DIAL, you can also use applications deployed and hosted outside the DIAL infrastructure. You can enable such applications via DIAL API (including DIAL Chat UI wizards), a direct modification of DIAL Core configuration or in [DIAL Admin](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/entities-applications.md).

## Application Lifecycle Management

DIAL Platform provides comprehensive tools and features to support the complete application lifecycle, from initial concept to ongoing maintenance. Our integrated environment streamlines each phase of SDLC, ensuring applications can be efficiently created, tested, deployed, and managed.

The following sections detail the capabilities available at each stage of the application lifecycle: 

* [Development](#development) 
* [Testing and Evaluation](#testing-and-evaluation) 
* [Release](#testing-and-release) 
* [Operations](#operations) 

### Development

DIAL Platform includes a rich set of tools for developers to streamline the development process. Refer to [Develop](#develop) section for more details.

### Testing and Evaluation

DIAL includes tools to help you test, experiment and evaluate applications before releasing them:

* **Evaluation toolkit**: We created a special UI and a library to calculate metrics and assess the quality of information retrieval and generation of any RAG-like application.
* **Access to application logs**: You can use [DIAL API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Applications/operation/getApplicationLogs) and [DIAL Chat UI](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#to-access-code-app-logs) to view logs of Code apps.
* **Observability and troubleshooting**: DIAL leverages OpenTelemetry (OTEL) to enable system monitoring. A comprehensive metrics and tracing capabilities help identify bottlenecks, analyze health and performance, visualize metrics in tools like Grafana and PowerBI.  Refer to [Observability](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/3.observability-config.md) for more details. 
* **Usage analytics**: DIAL setup can include a special service called DIAL Analytics Realtime, which uses diverse techniques such as embedding algorithms, clustering algorithms, frameworks, light-weight self-hosted language models, to analyze chat completion logs and extract the needed information, which can be presented in tools such as Grafana for visualization and analytics. Refer to [Analytics](/docs/platform/6.realtime-analytics-intro.md) for more details.

### Release

Until you release your application, it is accessible only to you as an application creator. Once it is published, system administrators can access and manage it via API or DIAL Admin Panel.

Once your application is ready to be released you can share it with selected users or publish it on [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md) to make it available to a wider audience.

By sharing, you give READ or WRITE access to your application to specific users and can revoke it at any time. You can share an application via both [DIAL Chat UI](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#share-app) and [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing). Note, that you can also grant permissions to reshare the application.

Publishing displays the application on DIAL Marketplace and gives access to it to users of specific roles or all users, depending on the configuration you provided in the publication request. Published applications and available via the marketplace, DIAL Chat and API. Publishing an application requires approval from the platform administrator. You can revoke access to the application published on the Marketplace at any time after the approval of the request by the platform administrator.

### Operation & Collaboration

Users can manage their applications through the [DIAL Chat Workspace](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#my-workspace) or via the [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api). These interfaces allow users to access, edit, revoke form usage, collaborate with others, and perform additional actions on their applications.

DIAL Platform supports collaboration between users when developing and using applications:

* **Marketplace**: Share your apps on [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md) for broader visibility, or discover and use applications published by others, creating a collaborative community hub.
* **Use Agents Created by Other Users**: From your application code, you can call agents, using DIAL Unified API, created and published by other users. You can enable other users to use your apps as agents as well. This creates a collaborative environment where agents can be re-used as building blocks for creating multi-agent applications.
* **Real-time Co-development**: DIAL enables real-time collaboration when developing applications. You can grant [WRITE permissions](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#sharing-with-editing-rights) to other users, allowing you to work on the same application simultaneously.
