# DIAL as Application Server

## Introduction

The DIAL Platform enables the creation, hosting, deployment, and management of GenAI applications, as well as their sharing, distribution, and collaboration with other users.

## Create Apps

### Develop

You can use DIAL Platform as a development studio, leveraging its SDK and API to develop GenAI applications. When developing apps, you can use a technology of your preference, be it any LLM framework, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, vector DBs or any other.

The platform includes a rich set of tools and features to help you build applications, such as:

* **Agents**: Following the agentic approach, DIAL-native applications (yours and created by other users) can be used as building blocks to create new applications. It allows reusing existing solutions and build powerful multi-agent apps faster.
* **Unified Protocol**: DIAL Core unified protocol is built to be compatible with OpenAI API, which facilitates the development and integration of new applications. It is a single and unified protocol for all applications and models deployed in DIAL. It supports MCP server calling, tool calling, streaming, seeds, multi modality and more.
* **Middleware**: DIAL includes rich middleware you can use out of the box to create powerful apps, focusing on your core business instead of reinventing the wheel. You can access powerful tool out-of-the box like app evaluation toolset, observability tools, rich collection of language models, load balancer supporting different algos and PTU, interceptors, RBAC, tools for managing logs and debugging apps and more. 
* **Application Runners**: DIAL Core supports the concept of application runners, offering, in a SaaS edition, several application types you can use as templates to create apps. Self-hosted DIAL editions enable the creation of custom runners for specific use cases. DIAL application types can include a UI to enable end-users to create applications using no and low-code wizard on UI.
* **API-First**: DIAL follows an API-First approach, enabling access to all its features via a unified API.

### Test and Experiment

DIAL allows you to test your apps before going live. You can leverage tool to evaluate the performance, fine-tune load balancing, costs, configurations and more.

* **Experiment and Prototype**: Pre-built application runners enable quick prototyping and experiments with different types of applications, allowing you to quickly build POCs and choose the best option.
* **Sandbox**: Before going live, you can text and fine-tune your application e.g. load balancing, tokens usage, access control, models usage, experiment with different agents for specific tasks, experiment with guardrails and more. After going live, you can create versions and edit your app at any time.
* **Evaluation**: Evaluation toolkit enables research and analysis of RAG-like applications performance, allowing to compare retrieval using specific metrics.

## Host and Deploy

Apps enables in DIAL get automatically hosted on the DIAL infrastructure, releasing you from bothering about scaling, file storage, availability, resource optimization, infrastructure security, deployment and other tasks.

Code apps allow you to deploy, version, run, manage env variables, access logs and undeploy your custom Python apps in a few clicks. 

App runners such as Mind Map and Quick Apps let you create apps using UI wizards, test, run, and publish them in a no-code manner, making them available to a wide audience in a few clicks.

## Manage and Operate

DIAL Admin allows platform administrators to manage application runners, deploy and undeploy apps from users. From their admins can monitor apps vitals, issue access credentials, revoke apps from usage, apply guardrails, control token usage policy and much more.

Apps owners can manage their applications right in the DIAL Chat Workspace, where they can edit apps, issue versions, access logs, deploy and undeploy apps, share apps with other users or publish them for a selected audience.

Admin, analytics, monitoring, logs, undeploy, version, access control, tokens limits, interceptors, revoke access, keys and roles.

Edit, deploy, undeploy apps. Issue versioning.

## Collaborate

Deploy apps can be available just for the application owner or a selected audience.

Share, unshare, re-share, publish, unpublish, access control, write access, read access

Real-time collaboration on apps development.
