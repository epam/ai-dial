# DIAL as Application Server

## Introduction

DIAL serves as a robust application server designed to facilitate the development, hosting, deployment, and management of GenAI applications. It provides a comprehensive environment for developers to create applications that leverage advanced AI capabilities, while also offering tools for collaboration and sharing within the DIAL community.

## Create Apps

### Develop



You can use DIAL Platform as a development studio, leveraging its [SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk) and [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) to develop GenAI applications. When developing apps, you can use a technology of your preference, be it any LLM framework, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, vector DBs or any other.

The platform includes a rich set of tools and features to help you build applications, such as:

* **Agents**: Following the [agentic approach](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md), [DIAL-native applications](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md) (yours and created by other users) can be used as building blocks to create new applications. It allows reusing existing solutions and build powerful multi-agent apps faster.
* **Unified Protocol**: DIAL Core [unified protocol](/docs/platform/3.core/0.about-core.md#unified-api) is built to be compatible with OpenAI API, which facilitates the development and integration of new applications. It is a single and unified protocol for all applications and models deployed in DIAL. It supports MCP server calling, tool calling, streaming, seeds, multi modality and more.
* **Middleware**: DIAL includes rich middleware you can use out of the box to create powerful apps, focusing on your core business instead of reinventing the wheel. You can access many tools out-of-the box like [app evaluation toolkit](/docs/video%20demos/3.Developers/Applications/6.dial-rag-eval.md), [observability](/docs/platform/8.observability-intro.md) tools, rich collection of [language models](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md), [load balancer](/docs/platform/3.core/5.load-balancer.md) supporting different algos and PTU, [interceptors](/docs/platform/3.core/6.interceptors.md), [RBAC](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md), tools for managing logs and debugging apps and more. 
* **Application Runners**: DIAL Core supports the concept of application runners, offering, in a SaaS edition, several [application types](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#application-types) you can use as templates to create apps. Self-hosted DIAL editions enable the creation of custom runners for specific use cases. DIAL application types can include a UI to [enable end-users to create applications](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#application-builder) using no and low-code wizard on UI.
* **API-First**: DIAL follows an API-First approach, enabling access to all its features via a [unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api).

### Test and Experiment

DIAL allows you to test your apps before going live. You can leverage tool to evaluate the performance, fine-tune load balancing, costs, configurations and more.

* **Experiment and Prototype**: Pre-built application runners enable quick prototyping and experiments with different types of applications, allowing you to quickly build POCs and choose the best option. Refer to [application types](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#application-types) for more details.
* **Sandbox**: Before going live, you can text and fine-tune your application e.g. load balancing, tokens usage, access control, models usage, experiment with different agents for specific tasks, experiment with guardrails and more. After going live, you can create versions and edit your app at any time.
* **Evaluation**: Evaluation toolkit enables research and analysis of RAG-like applications performance, allowing to compare retrieval using specific metrics.

## Host and Deploy

DIAL offers several ways to deploy your applications - you can use DIAL Core API, direct modification of DIAL Core configuration or UI wizards. Refer to [enable apps](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/3.enable-app.md) to learn more.

Deployed applications are automatically hosted on DIAL infrastructure, releasing you from bothering about scaling, file storage, availability, resource optimization, infrastructure security, deployment and other tasks.

Deployed apps can be undeployed or deleted by both application owners, users with corresponding permissions and system administrators.

## Manage and Operate

DIAL includes tools for both system administrators and developers to manage applications.

* **Administrators**: [DIAL Admin](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md) allows platform administrators to manage application runners, deploy and undeploy applications, monitor vitals, issue access credentials, revoke apps from usage, apply guardrails, control token usage policy and much more.
* **Developers**: Apps owners can manage their applications right in the [DIAL Chat Workspace](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#my-workspace), where they can edit apps, issue versions, access logs, deploy and undeploy apps, share apps with other users or publish them for a selected audience.

## Collaborate

Authors of applications can [share](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#share-app) them with other users or [publish](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#publish-app) to a selected audience, by listing apps in [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md). DIAL enables real-time collaboration by granting editing permissions to other users, allowing them to work on the same application simultaneously.

At any time, you can revoke access or edit your application. DIAL support versioning, allowing for a more controlled development process.
