# DIAL as Application Server

## Introduction

DIAL can act as an application server facilitating the development, hosting, deployment, and management of GenAI applications. 

##### Why use DIAL?

With DIAL, you not only get access to a comprehensive environment for development of GenAI applications, but also rich middleware allowing you to focus on the most important things instead of reinventing the wheel, as well as operation and collaboration tools to manage and control the entire GenAI SDLC of your applications.

## Develop

You can use DIAL Platform as a development studio, to create GenAI applications. There are two ways to do this: 

* **Developing from scratch**: You can develop an application from scratch yourself. DIAL offers [SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk) and a unified [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) to streamline the process. When developing apps, you can use a technology of your preference, be it any LLM framework, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, vector DBs or any other. Apps created with DIAL API and SDK will be compatible with the unified protocol of DIAL and can be used as [agents](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md) (building blocks) for creating multi-agent applications.
* **Create apps based on Application Runners**: You can use available to you application runners as [schema-based templates](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#schema-rich-applications) for creating applications. Application runners can include [application builders](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#application-builder) with UI allowing end-users of DIAL Chat to create apps in a no-code fashion. DIAL SaaS edition provides several application runners ([Quick Apps](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#quick-apps), [Code Apps](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#code-apps), and [Mind Maps](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#mind-maps)) you can use as templates for creating applications of predefined types, including no and low-code UI wizards for end-users. Self-hosted DIAL edition enables creation of custom application runners to implement specific business cases.  


The platform includes a rich set of tools and features to help you build powerful and multi-agentic applications, such as:

* **[API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api)**: DIAL follows an API-First approach, enabling access to all its features via a [Unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api).
* **[SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk)**: A framework to create [applications](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md) and [model adapters](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/3.components.md#llm-adapters) for DIAL. Applications and model adapters implemented using this framework will be compatible with DIAL API that was designed based on Azure OpenAI API.
* **[Unified Protocol](/docs/platform/3.core/0.about-core.md#unified-api)**: DIAL Core unified protocol is built to be compatible with OpenAI API, which facilitates the development and integration of new applications. It is a single and unified protocol for all applications and models deployed in DIAL. It supports MCP server calling, tool calling, streaming, seeds, multi modality and more.
* **[Agents](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md#introduction)**: You can use [DIAL Unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) to call any other deployed [agent](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md#types-of-agents) (yours or created by other users based on your permissions) from your application's code. It allows reusing existing agents as components in your apps for creating multi-agent workflows faster.
* **Application Runners**: DIAL supports the concept of application runners. They serve as schema-based templates for creating apps. You can use standard app runners or create your own in self-hosted editions of DIAL. Refer to [Schema-Rich Applications](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#schema-rich-applications) for more details.
* **Experimentation and Prototyping**: Application Runners enable users to quickly [create prototypes in a no-code manner](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#application-builder) and test them before going live. [Code apps](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#code-apps) enable power users to write and run a custom Python code directly in the DIAL Chat application and deploy it on the DIAL infrastructure in a few clicks. When ready, you can publish your apps on [Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md) or [share](/docs/platform/7.collaboration-intro.md#sharing) with specific users.
* **Middleware**: DIAL includes rich middleware you can use out of the box to create powerful apps, focusing on your core business instead of reinventing the wheel:
    * [Language models](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md): DIAL supports connectivity with main LLM vendors allowing you to configure the system to fit your preferences. You can also configure access to language models from the open-source community, alternative vendors, and fine-tuned micro models, as well as self-hosted or models listed on HuggingFace or DeepSeek. 
    * [Interceptors](/docs/platform/3.core/6.interceptors.md): Interceptors enable you to add custom logic to in/out requests for models and apps, enabling PII obfuscation, guardrails, safety checks, and beyond. 
    * [RBAC](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md): DIAL supports integration with various IDPs allowing you to support your custom RBAC system.
    * [Rate Limit](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/0.programmatic-auth.md#step-3-configure-limits-optional): DIAL enables you to define adaptable rate limits for JWT and API keys to control the usage of your applications and models.
    * [Load balancer](/docs/platform/3.core/5.load-balancer.md): DIAL includes a powerful load balancer with PTU support to enable the distribution of requests to LLMs across various resources, preventing bottlenecks, enhancing fault tolerance and keeping costs under control.
    * [Observability](/docs/platform/8.observability-intro.md): Tools powered by OpenTelemetry to get the insights about your system's performance and health.
    * [Evaluation toolkit](/docs/video%20demos/3.Developers/Applications/6.dial-rag-eval.md): Evaluation toolkit is a set of tools to evaluate retrieval and generation of RAG-like applications.
    * Tools for collection and visualization of usage analytics, managing logs and debugging apps and more. 

## Host and Deploy

##### Apps created based on application runners

All applications created based on [Application Runners](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#application-types) (e.g. Quick Apps, Code Apps and Mind Maps) get automatically hosted and deployed on the DIAL infrastructure. This means that you do not need to worry about the underlying infrastructure, as DIAL takes care of such tasks as hosting, scaling, file storage, and managing the applications for you.

##### Apps deployed outside DIAL

In DIAL, you can also use applications deployed and hosted outside the DIAL infrastructure. You can enable such applications via DIAL API (including DIAL Chat UI wizards), a direct modification of DIAL Core configuration or in [DIAL Admin](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/entities-applications.md). Refer to [Tutorials for Developers](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/3.enable-app.md) to learn more.

## Manage and Operate

DIAL includes UI and API for both system administrators and developers to manage applications.

##### Platform Administrators

DIAL platform administrators can use [DIAL Admin Panel](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md) or [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) to manage the entire DIAL platform, including apps published and deployed in DIAL:

**Note**, system admins cannot access nor modify private apps (apps that have not been published).

* [Applications](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/entities-applications.md): Administrators can enable/disable, configure, deploy/undeploy, monitor metrics of all deployed apps in DIAL.
* [Application Runners](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/builders-application-runners.md): Administrators can add and manage application runners and apps assigned to them.

> Refer to [DIAL Admin](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md) to learn more.

##### Application Owners

Application owners can manage their applications right in the [DIAL Chat Workspace](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#my-workspace) or via [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api), where they can:

* [Access all deployed apps](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Deployment-listing/operation/getApplications) and [application runners](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Applications/operation/listCustomApplicationSchemas) based on their permissions.
* [Edit applications](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#edit-app) before and after releasing them.
* Use versioning to maintain a transparent history of application development.
* Access [application logs](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Applications/operation/getApplicationLogs) for deployed apps.
* Access application [files](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Files).
* [Deploy](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Applications/operation/deployApplication) and [undeploy](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Applications/operation/undeployApplication) applications.
* [Share](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Sharing/operation/shareResource) applications with other users or [publish](https://dialx.ai/dial_api#tag/Publications/operation/createPublication) them for a selected audience.

## Collaborate

DIAL Platform supports collaboration between users when developing and using applications:

* DIAL enables authors of applications to [share](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#share-app) them with other users or [publish](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#publish-app) to a selected audience. Published applications are listed on [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md) and become available via API to the selected user roles. 
* You can use [DIAL Unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) to call [agents](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md#types-of-agents) developed by other users from your applications, provided you have the necessary permissions. You can enable other users to use your apps as agents as well. This creates a collaborative environment where agents can be re-used as building blocks for creating multi-agent applications.
* DIAL enables real-time collaboration when developing applications. You can grant [WRITE permissions](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#sharing-with-editing-rights) to other users, allowing you to work on the same application simultaneously.
* You can revoke access to the application published on the Marketplace at any time after the approval of the request by the platform administrator. You do not need an approval from the administrator to revoke access to the application shared with other users.
