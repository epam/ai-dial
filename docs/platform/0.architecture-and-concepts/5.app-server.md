# DIAL as Application Server

## Introduction

DIAL can act as an application server facilitating the development, hosting, deployment, and management of GenAI applications. 

##### Why use DIAL?

With DIAL, you not only get access to a comprehensive environment for development of GenAI applications, but also rich middleware allowing you to focus on the most important things instead of reinventing the wheel, as well as operation and collaboration tools to manage and control the entire GenAI SDLC of your applications.

## Develop

You can use DIAL Platform as a development studio, to create GenAI applications. DIAL offers two ways to do this: 

* **Developing from Scratch**: You can develop an application from scratch yourself. DIAL offers [SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk) and a unified [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) to streamline the process. When developing apps, you can use a technology of your preference, be it any LLM framework, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, vector DBs or any other. Apps created with DIAL API and SDK will be compatible with the unified protocol of DIAL and can be used as agents (building blocks) for creating multi-agent applications.
* **Using Application Runners**: DIAL SaaS edition provides several application runners you can use as templates for creating applications of predefined types, including no and low-code UI wizards for end-users. Self-hosted DIAL edition enables creation of custom application runners to implement specific business cases.  


The platform includes a rich set of tools and features to help you build powerful and multi-agentic applications, such as:

* **[API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api)**: DIAL follows an API-First approach, enabling access to all its features via a [unified API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api).
* **[SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk)**: A framework to create applications and model adapters for DIAL. Applications and model adapters implemented using this framework will be compatible with DIAL API that was designed based on Azure OpenAI API.
* **[Unified Protocol](/docs/platform/3.core/0.about-core.md#unified-api)**: DIAL Core unified protocol is built to be compatible with OpenAI API, which facilitates the development and integration of new applications. It is a single and unified protocol for all applications and models deployed in DIAL. It supports MCP server calling, tool calling, streaming, seeds, multi modality and more.
* **[Agents](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/4.agentic-platform.md#introduction)**: Following the agentic approach, [DIAL-native applications](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md) (yours and created by other users) can be used as building blocks to create new applications. It allows reusing existing solutions and building powerful multi-agent apps faster.
* **Application Runners**: DIAL Core supports the concept of application runners, offering, in a SaaS edition, several [application types](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#application-types) you can use as templates to create apps. Self-hosted DIAL editions enable the creation of custom runners for specific use cases. DIAL application types can include a UI to [enable end-users to create applications](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#application-builder) using no and low-code wizard on UI.
* **Experimentation and Prototyping**: DIAL enables prototyping and creation of POCs to quickly test and evaluate your ideas before going live. Experiment with application types, different models, define your rate limits, access control, load balancing and more. Refer to [application types](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#application-types) for more details.
* **Middleware**: DIAL includes rich middleware you can use out of the box to create powerful apps, focusing on your core business instead of reinventing the wheel:
    * [Evaluation toolkit](/docs/video%20demos/3.Developers/Applications/6.dial-rag-eval.md): Evaluation toolkit is a set of tools to evaluate retrieval and generation of RAG-like applications.
    * [Observability](/docs/platform/8.observability-intro.md): Tools powered by OpenTelemetry to get the insights about your system's performance and health.
    * [Language models](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md): DIAL supports connectivity with main LLM vendors allowing you to configure the system to fit your preferences. You can also configure access to language models from the open-source community, alternative vendors, and fine-tuned micro models, as well as self-hosted or models listed on HuggingFace or DeepSeek. 
    * [Load balancer](/docs/platform/3.core/5.load-balancer.md): DIAL includes a powerful load balancer with PTU support to enable the distribution of requests to LLMs across various resources, preventing bottlenecks, enhancing fault tolerance and keeping costs under control.
    * [Interceptors](/docs/platform/3.core/6.interceptors.md): Interceptors enable you to add custom logic to in/out requests for models and apps, enabling PII obfuscation, guardrails, safety checks, and beyond. 
    * [RBAC](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md): DIAL supports integration with various IDPs allowing you to support your custom RBAC system.
    * [Rate Limit](/docs/tutorials/2.devops/2.auth-and-access-control/0.programmatic-auth.md#step-3-configure-limits-optional): DIAL enables you to define adaptable rate limits for JWT and API keys to control the usage of your applications and models.
    * Tools for collection and visualization of usage analytics, managing logs and debugging apps and more. 

## Host and Deploy

All applications created based on [Application Runners](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md#application-types) (Quick Apps, Code Apps and Mind Maps) get automatically hosted and deployed on the DIAL infrastructure. This means that you do not need to worry about the underlying infrastructure, as DIAL takes care of such tasks as hosting, scaling, file storage, and managing the applications for you.

If your application is deployed and hosted outside the DIAL infrastructure, there are several ways for you to enable such apps in DIAL: via DIAL API, UI wizards and a direct modification of DIAL Core configuration. Refer to [enable apps](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/3.enable-app.md) to learn more.

## Manage and Operate

DIAL includes UI and API for both system administrators and developers to manage applications.

##### Platform Administrators

DIAL platform administrators can use [DIAL Admin Panel](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md) or [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) to manage the entire DIAL platform, including applications:

* [Applications](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/entities-applications.md): Administrators can enable/disable, configure, deploy/undeploy, monitor metrics of all deployed apps in DIAL.
* [Application Runners](/docs/tutorials/3.admin/builders-application-runners.md): Administrators can add and manage application runners and apps assigned to them.

> Refer to [DIAL Admin](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel.md) to learn more.

##### Application Owners

Application owners can manage their applications right in the [DIAL Chat Workspace](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#my-workspace) or via [API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api), where they can:

* Access all deployed apps and application runners based on their permissions.
* Edit applications before and after releasing them.
* Use versioning to maintain a transparent history of application development.
* Access application logs.
* Access application files.
* Deploy and undeploy applications.
* Share applications with other users or publish them for a selected audience.

## Collaborate

DIAL Platform supports collaboration between users when using and developing applications:

* DIAL enables authors of applications to [share](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#share-app) them with other users or [publish](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#publish-app) to a selected audience. Published applications are listed on [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md) and become available via API to the selected user roles. 
* Following the agentic approach, DIAL enables you to leverage [DIAL-native applications](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md) developed by other users, provided you have the necessary permissions, as building blocks in your apps. You can enable other users to use your apps as agents as well.
* DIAL enables real-time collaboration when developing applications. You can grant [editing permissions](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#sharing-with-editing-rights) to other users, allowing you to work on the same application simultaneously.
* You can revoke access to the application published on the marketplace at any time after the approval of the request by the platform administrator. You do not need an approval from the administrator to revoke access to the application shared with other users.
