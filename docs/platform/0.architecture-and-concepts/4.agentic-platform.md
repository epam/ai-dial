# DIAL as Agentic Platform

## Introduction

DIAL can serve as an [Agentic Platform](https://dialx.ai/agentic-platform), where any existing agent can be used as a building block to create a new agent. You can build simple conversational agents or powerful multi-agent and multi-modal applications solving specific business tasks.

##### What is agent?

Agents in DIAL, are all available [language models](#model-adapters) and [DIAL-native applications](#create-dial-native-app).

## How to use agents?

##### End-users
In [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md), you can find all agents available to you (or any other user) based on your user's roles and permissions. 

> Watch a [demo video](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/2.marketplace.md) to learn more about DIAL Marketplace.

To use an agent, [select it](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#converse) and start a conversation. When using a multi-agent application, agents are selected and assigned to designated tasks automatically. If the application allows this, it is possible to switch agents during the ongoing conversation in the [conversation settings](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#conversation-settings).

##### Developers

DIAL simplifies application development by allowing you to build applications using agents as modular components. This approach removes the need to duplicate existing functionalities, saving time and effort. The platform utilizes a [Unified API of DIAL](https://dialx.ai/dial_api), which provides a standardized interface (OpenAI API compatible) for interacting with all available in DIAL applications and models, simplifying the development process.

:cloud: DIAL SaaS edition includes pre-built agents you can reuse in your apps as building blocks following the [unified protocol](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) of DIAL. Provided you have corresponding permissions, you can access agents built by other users as well and use them as building blocks in your apps. Agents can be shared and made available within the community, providing additional flexibility and opportunities to reuse existing solutions.

> Refer to [ChatHub video demo](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/3.dial-chathub.md) to see the example of a multi-agent application that can be built on the DIAL Platform.

## Create DIAL-Native App

**DIAL-native apps** have API that adheres to the [unified protocol](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) of DIAL. 

> Refer to [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/3.enable-app.md#dial-native-applications) to learn more about DIAL-native applications and how to enable them in DIAL

##### How to create a DIAL-native application: 

**Development**: You can develop DIAL-native apps using [DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk/blob/development/README.md) following [DIAL API](https://dialx.ai/dial_api). The unified protocol of DIAL supports tool calling, seeds, token usage, streaming and more. Refer to [DIAL Core](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/3.components.md#ai-dial-core) to learn more about unified protocol features.

> * Having your app running, refer to [Tutorials for developers](/tutorials/developers/apps-development/enable-app) to learn how to enable it in DIAL and allow others to use it.
> * Refer to [Cookbook examples](docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/3.multimodality/dial-cookbook/examples/how_to_call_text_to_text_applications.mdx) to learn how to create apps of different modalities.
> * Refer to [Video Demo](/docs/video%20demos/3.Developers/Applications/5.develop-application.md) to learn how to develop a simple application.
> * Watch a [Video Demo](/docs/video%20demos/3.Developers/3.dial-unified-api.md) about the unified protocol of DIAL.

**UI Wizards**: [Schema-rich applications](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/3.enable-app.md#schema-rich-applications) can support UI wizards allowing end-users to create apps of specific [application types](#application-types).

> * Refer to [User Guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#applications) to learn how to create applications using UI wizards.
> * Refer to [Tutorials for developers](/tutorials/developers/apps-development/enable-app#enable-schema-rich-applications) to learn how to enable schema-rich apps in DIAL.


### Application Types

Application types can be seen as schema-rich templates for creating custom implementations of specific application types. One of the main advantages of application types, is that they allow adding [application wizards](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#application-builder) on UI for end-users to create/edit apps in a low and no-code manner.

:cloud: DIAL SaaS edition includes application types: Quick app, Code app and Mindmap. 

:floppy_disk: In self-hosted deployments of DIAL you can add new application types that can implement any logic, use fully custom UI (even non-conversational) and custom application wizard.

> Refer to [Developer Tutorials](/tutorials/developers/apps-development/enable-app) to learn how to enable DIAL-native apps.

#### Quick Apps

Quick apps are code-less and conceptually similar to OpenAI's GPTs. They can include tools such as client toolsets, web API toolsets, use apps and models deployed in DIAL as tools and URLs to files to perform specific actions. For example, you can create an app with a toolset allowing it to call an external API to get a real-time weather forecast for a specific location. Another example is a RAG-like application that can generate responses based on predefined sources.

> * Watch a [Demo Video](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/5.quick-apps.md) with an introduction to Quick Apps.
> * Refer to [User guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#add-quick-app) to learn how to add Quick Apps.
> * Refer to [Quick App Configuration Guide](/docs/tutorials/1.developers/4.apps-development/5.quick-app-configuration.md) to see configuration guidelines and a full configuration example for Quick app.

#### Code Apps

Code Apps allow you to develop, deploy and run your Python applications directly in the DIAL Chat. It is a useful tool if you need to quickly create an application for the POC, deploy it and share with the selected audience.  

> * Watch a [Demo Video](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/4.code-apps.md) with an introduction to Code Apps.
> * Refer to [User guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#add-code-app) to learn how to add Code Apps.

#### Mindmaps

Mindmap enables users to explore information through an interactive knowledge graph and using natural language. You can use this application type to create an app which pulls data from various sources, including documents, URLs, and other data inputs and then presents it on UI as a interactive knowledge graph, facilitating intuitive and engaging user interactions with information. The [home page](https://dialx.ai/) of the DIALX landing website is built using this technology. 

> * Watch [Demo Video](/docs/video%20demos/2.Applications/mindmap-studio.md) to see DIAL Mindmap Studio in action. 
> * Refer to solutions to see implementations in specific industries: [Caspase-2 Article Visualization](https://dialx.ai/solutions/scientific-literature-knowledge-graph), [OMICS AI Assistant](https://dialx.ai/solutions/omics-data-assistant), [Visualization of Cinematic Universe](https://dialx.ai/solutions/lotr-universe-case) 

## Model Adapters

DIAL includes connectors to all major LLM vendors such as Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and Azure OpenAI. You can also work with open-source and micro models, self-hosted or models listed on HuggingFace or DeepSeek.

> Refer to [available language models](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md) to see the list of supported models and available model adapters.
