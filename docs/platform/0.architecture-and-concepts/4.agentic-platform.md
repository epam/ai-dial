# DIAL as Agentic Platform

## Introduction

DIAL can serve as an [Agentic Platform](https://dialx.ai/agentic-platform), where any existing agent can be used as a building block when developing applications. You can build simple conversational agents or powerful multi-agent and multi-modal applications solving specific business tasks.

## Types of Agents

### DIAL-Native Apps

**DIAL-native apps** have API that adheres to the [unified protocol](/docs/platform/0.architecture-and-concepts/3.components.md#the-unified-protocol) of DIAL. 

> Refer to [DIAL-Native Apps](/docs/platform/3.core/7.apps.md) to learn more about them and available application types.

### Model Adapters

DIAL includes connectors to all major LLM vendors such as [Amazon Bedrock](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-bedrock/?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models), [Google Vertex AI](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-vertexai/?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-models), and [Azure OpenAI](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-openai). You can also work with open-source and micro models, self-hosted or models listed on HuggingFace or DeepSeek.

> Refer to [available language models](/docs/platform/2.supported-models.md) to see the list of supported models and available model adapters.

## How to use agents?

##### End-users

In [DIAL Marketplace](/docs/platform/4.chat/1.marketplace.md), you can find all agents available to you (or any other user) based on your user's roles and permissions. 

> Watch a [demo video](/docs/video%20demos/1.Chat/2.marketplace.md) to learn more about DIAL Marketplace.

To use an agent, [select it](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#converse) and start a conversation. When using a multi-agent application, agents are selected and assigned to designated tasks automatically. If the application allows this, it is possible to switch agents during the ongoing conversation in the [conversation settings](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#conversation-settings).

> Refer to [User Guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#application-builder) to learn how to create apps with UI wizards.


##### Developers

DIAL simplifies application development by allowing you to build applications using agents as modular components. This approach removes the need to duplicate existing functionalities, saving time and effort. The platform utilizes a [Unified API of DIAL](https://dialx.ai/dial_api), which provides a standardized interface (OpenAI API compatible) for interacting with all available in DIAL applications and models, simplifying the development process.

:cloud: DIAL SaaS edition includes pre-built agents you can reuse in your apps as building blocks following the [unified protocol](https://dialx.ai/dial_api) of DIAL. Provided you have corresponding permissions, you can access agents built by other users as well and use them as building blocks in your apps. Agents can be shared and made available within the community, providing additional flexibility and opportunities to reuse existing solutions.
