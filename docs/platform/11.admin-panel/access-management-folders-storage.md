## About Folders Storage

The Folders Storage section of DIAL Admin lets you control which users or roles can browse and access different directories in the [Assets (Prompts & Files) area](/docs/platform/11.admin-panel/assets-files.md). On this screen, you can define per-folder Access Control Lists (ACLs) rules.

## Folders List

The **Folders Storage** section is where you manage all folders and their hierarchy.

### Folders Hierarchy

**Folders Structure (Left Pane)**: Shows a hierarchical view of all storage folders under the root.

| Element                  | Behavior                                                                                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Public folder**        | A root folder accessible to all users.                                                         |
| **User-defined folders** | Collapsible folders you create to group files by project, team, domain, or environment.   |

### Folders Permissions

When a folder is selected, the right pane displays its access-control rules which determine who can view or add assets in the selected folder.

Rules can be nested under **And/Or** blocks to form complex access policies:
* **And**: All rules must be satisfied.
* **Or**: At least one rule must be satisfied.

> **Note**: If a folder has a parent folder, all access rules of a parent folder also apply to the child folder.
