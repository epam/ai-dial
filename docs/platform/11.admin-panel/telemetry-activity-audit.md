# Activity Audit

## About Activity Audit

The Activity Audit page is your system-wide "black box recorder". It captures every change anyone makes in the Admin Panel (who, what, and when) so you could trace, verify, and, if needed, roll back any action.

## Activity Audit List

On the main Activity Audit screen, you can view all events that has happened in DIAL Admin Panel.

##### Top Bar Controls

* **Time Period** filter: A dropdown control that scopes the Activity-Audit table to a custom period range.
* **Refresh** button: Manually refreshes the entries on the page honoring all active filters and the selected **Time Period** to pull the latest audit events

### Entry Details

The Activity-Audit Entry page is the detailed drill-down for a single audit event.
It lets you inspect exactly what changed in a resource, who did it, and when, with a side-by-side "before/after" diff that can be rolled back with one click.

#### Review Changes

* **Categories** (e.g., *Features*, *Roles*, *Interceptors*). Groups all changes that belong to one logical section of the respective resource (Model, Application, etc.). Click to expand/collapse. A numeric badge shows the number of distinct changes.
* **Before/After columns**. Side-by-side diff that shows the previous and resulting values for every field in the section. Each row is color-coded to signal the type of operation performed:
    * **Green** (`Create`). A field was **added** in the *After* state and did not exist before.
    * **Blue** (`Update`). A field's value was **modified** - both Before and After state rows rows are highlighted in blue.
    * **Red** (`Delete`). A field was **removed** - it is present in the *Before* state but absent (or struck-through) in the *After* state.

#### Resource Rollback

Use Resource Rollback to restore the previous version of the related resource. A rollback leads to generation of a new entry on the audit activity screen.
