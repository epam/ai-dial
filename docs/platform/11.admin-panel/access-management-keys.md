## About API Keys

In DIAL, API Keys play a crucial role in managing access and ensuring security:

* API keys are used for authentication and access control.
* They can be configured to be secured and can have specific roles and limits assigned to them.
* API keys are essential for external applications accessing language models and applications deployed in AI DIAL.

> Refer to [Access & Cost Control](/docs/platform/3.core/2.access-control-intro.md#api-keys) to learn more. 

## Keys List

The Keys page provides a centralized view and management interface for all API keys in DIAL Admin.

##### Keys Grid

| Column | Definition |
|-------------------------|------------|
| **Name**     | User-friendly identifier of the key (e.g. `analytics-service-key`). Names help you map keys to consumers or services in logs and configs. |
| **Description**   | Optional notes explaining the key‚Äôs purpose, owner/team, or special instructions.   |
| **Key generation time** | Timestamp when the key was created. Useful for auditing and correlating key use with system changes or deployments.|
| **Expiration time**     | Timestamp when the key automatically becomes invalid. Setting expirations enforces regular key rotation. |
| **Status**   | Current key's lifecycle state.|


## Create Keys

Use the **Create Key** dialog to register a key in your DIAL instance. Once added, it appears in the **Keys** listing.
