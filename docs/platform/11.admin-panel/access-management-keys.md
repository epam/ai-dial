## What Is a ‚ÄúKey‚Äù in DIAL?

In DIAL, API Keys play a crucial role in managing access and ensuring security:

   * API keys are used for authentication and access control.
   * They can be configured to be secured and can have specific roles and limits assigned to them.
   * API keys are essential for external applications accessing language models and applications deployed in AI DIAL.

More information on the API keys in DIAL Core documentation: 

* https://docs.dialx.ai/platform/core/access-control-intro#api-keys

## Keys Listing

The Keys page provides a centralized view and management interface for all API keys in DIAL Admin.

### 1. Navigate to Keys

In the sidebar, expand **Access Management** and click **Keys**.

### 2. Keys Grid

**Filtering & Sorting**
* Each column header has sort arrows; click to reorder.
* Beneath each header is a filter box - type text to narrow the list in real time.

| Column                  | Definition                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**                | Human-friendly identifier for the key (e.g. `analytics-service-key`). Names help you map keys to consumers or services in logs and configs. |
| **Description**         | Optional notes explaining the key‚Äôs purpose, owner/team, or special instructions.                                                           |
| **Key generation time** | Timestamp when the key was created. Useful for auditing and correlating key use with system changes or deployments.                         |
| **Expiration time**     | Timestamp when the key automatically becomes invalid. Setting expirations enforces regular key rotation.                                    |
| **Status**              | Current key's lifecycle state.                                                                                                              |
