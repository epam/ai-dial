## What Are “File Publications” in DIAL?

File Publication in DIAL is the workflow by which end-users push files from their chat sessions into the shared “Assets → Files” library—but only after an administrator has reviewed and approved them.

## File Publications Listing

The File Publications view under Approvals is where administrators review user-submitted files that have been shared from the DIAL chat interface and decide whether to publish them into the central Assets → Files repository or to decline them.

## File Publications - Review Page

When a DIAL Core user publishes a file from a chat session, it appears here for administration approval. 
On the File Publications → Review page, you inspect each file-request and either Publish it into the central Assets store or Decline it (with feedback).
