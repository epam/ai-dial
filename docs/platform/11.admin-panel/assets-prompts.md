# Prompts

## About Prompts

Prompts in DIAL are reusable, versioned text templates that can be used either in the chat or by custom applications.
Everything from system instructions ("You are a financial advisor…") to few-short examples and user-message wrappers.

> Refer to [User Guide](/docs/tutorials/0.user-guide.md#prompts) to learn more about prompts and DIAL Chat features.

## Prompts List

In the Prompts section, you can manage all system and user prompt templates. Here, you can also arrange prompts into folders, version them, and then use them in applications or chats.

## Create

1. Select a folder for a new prompt (e.g. public/marketing, private/project-x).
2. Click **Create** to invoke the **Create Prompt** modal.
3. Define prompt's parameters

    | Column          | Definition |
    |-----------------|-----------------------|
    | **Name**        | A unique identifier for a prompt (e.g. reject-blacklisted-words, audit-logger). This key is used when you attach it to a Model or Application. |
    | **Version**     | Semantic version string (e.g. 1.0.0, 0.1.2) that enables safe updates. |
    | **Description** | Free-text summary of the prompt’s purpose and key placeholders.  |

4. Once all required fields are filled, click **Create**. The dialog closes and the new prompt [configuration screen](#configuration) is opened. This entry will appear immediately in the listing once created.

##### To export prompts:

1. Click **Export** in the toolbar to launch the export modal 
2. Select the source folder containing prompts you want to export. You can export prompts from multiple folders at once.
3. You can **Select** prompts by checking the boxes in each row. You can also select the version you want to export. You can mix and match versions (e.g. export `prompt_A` v1.0.0 alongside `prompt_B` v0.1.2).
4. Click **Export** to start.

## Import

Use Import to upload new or update existing prompts from external JSON files or ZIP archive. This is essential for migrating, restoring, or sharing prompt assets between DIAL users.

##### To import prompts:

1. Click **Import** in the toolbar to launch the import modal 
2. Select the type of files you want to import. **Drag & Drop** your archive or JSON files into the files area or click **Browse** to open a file picker.
   * **Archive**: Select if you want to import a single ZIP or tarball containing multiple JSON files. **Note**: Only 1 archive can be imported at a time.
   * **JSON**: Select if you want to import JSON files. **Note**: Up to 30 files can be imported at once.
3. Select a Conflict resolution Strategy. It allows you to decide how to handle existing prompts with the same name and version in your workspace:
   * **Skip**: Leave existing prompts untouched, only new ones will be added.
   * **Override**: Replace prompts with the same name and version with the imported ones.
4. Click **Import** to start.

## Configuration

##### Top Bar Controls

* **Delete**: Permanently removes this prompt (or the selected versions) from your workspace. Any applications that reference it will break until you reattach a valid prompt.
* **JSON Editor** (Toggle): Switch between the form-based UI and raw [JSON view](#json-editor) of the prompt’s configuration. Use JSON mode for copy-paste or advanced edits.

### Properties

In the Properties tab, you can view and edit metadata and the template content of prompts.

|--------------------|-----------|--------|
| **Update Time**    | —         | Read-only timestamp of the last save (e.g. `04.29.2025 00:14`). Helps you track when the prompt was last modified.|

### JSON Editor

For advanced scenarios of bulk updates, copy/paste between environments, or tweaking settings not exposed in the form UI—you can switch to the **JSON Editor** in any prompt's configuration page.
