## Configuration Guidelines

### Configure Google OAuth2

> [!TIP]
> Replace `<chat_url>` with the actual address of your AI DIAL Chat application.

Follow these steps to configure Google OAuth2:

1. **Create an OAuth consent screen:** You can refer to the official Google documentation for detailed instructions on [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent).
1. **Create Client ID and Secret:** Click **Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID** and fill it:
    - Name
    - Application Type: `Web Application`
    - Authorized JavaScript Origins: `https://<chat_url>`
    - Authorized Redirect URLs: `https://<chat_url>/api/auth/callback/google`
1. Obtain and save **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the __OAuth Client__ modal
1. (Optional) **Create a Group and add members:** Once the application integration is set up, [create the necessary Group and add members in Google Group](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9400082?hl=en#zippy=%2Cstep-create-a-group).
1. (Optional) **Enable the Google Cloud Identity API:** Under [your organizationâ€™s dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudidentity.googleapis.com/) click `ENABLE` .

### Configure AI DIAL

To enable AI DIAL Chat and AI DIAL Core to work with Google OAuth2, configure them with the necessary specific parameters.

#### AI DIAL Chat Settings

Add the following environment variables to AI DIAL Chat configuration. Refer to [AI DIAL Chat](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-chat/blob/development/apps/chat/README.md#environment-variables) for more details.
  
      ```
      AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: "<google_client_id>"
      AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET: "<google_tenant_id>"
      AUTH_GOOGLE_SCOPE: "openid email profile https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.groups.readonly" # Optional
      ```

#### AI DIAL Core Settings

Add the following parameters to AI DIAL Core configuration. Refer to [AI DIAL Core](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) for more details.
   
  ```
  aidial.identityProviders.google.userInfoEndpoint: "https://openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo"
  aidial.identityProviders.google.rolePath: "fn:getGoogleWorkspaceGroups"
  aidial.identityProviders.google.loggingKey: "sub"
  aidial.identityProviders.google.loggingSalt: "loggingSalt"
  ```

#### Roles Management Guide

AI DIAL enables assignment of roles to Models, Applications, Addons, and Assistants to restrict the number of tokens that can be transmitted in a specific time frame. These roles and their limitations can be created in external systems and then assigned in AI DIAL's configuration.
Group management process is consisted of three steps:

1. Create a Group and add members in Google Group
1. Enable the Google Cloud Identity API
1. Configure AI DIAL Chat and Core
1. Assign roles to AI DIAL Models/Applications/Assistants/Addons

All the steps mentioned above have been completed, including the ones marked as **Optional**. The final step involves allocating Google Group towards AI DIAL Core configuration. The `aidial.identityProviders.google.rolePath` setting is leveraged for this purpose, alongside the `userRoles` section found within the description of the DIAL resource.

In this example, the roles are provided to AI DIAL Core from userinfo endpoint and are available via the path: `Groups` with values `google-group-name`

  ```yaml
  "models": {
      "chat-gpt-35-turbo": {
        "type": "chat",
        "endpoint" : "http://localhost:7001/v1/openai/deployments/gpt-35-turbo/chat/completions",
        "upstreams": [
          {"endpoint": "http://localhost:7001", "key": "modelKey1"}
        ],
        "userRoles": ["google-group-name"]
      }
  }
  ```
