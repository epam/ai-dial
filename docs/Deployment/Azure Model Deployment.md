    > It is important to note that certain models may not be accessible for deployment in a particular region. If you need a particular model, you will have to submit a separate request or relocate Azure OpenAI to a different region.

7. Go back to your model page and click **Keys and Endpoint**. In this section, you can find your key and endpoint that you will need to provide in [AI DIAL configuration file](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/8a2d6ebe301965ef0e4f06bc5f6e47aadc7b597f/charts/dial/examples/generic/simple/values.yaml#L17).

8. You can restrict access to your accounts based on a specific subset of networks by configuring network rules, only applications that access data through the designated set of networks are permitted to access the account. You can manage default network access rules for Azure AI services resources in **Resource Management/Networking**.
