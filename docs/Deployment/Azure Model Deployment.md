# OpenAI Model Deployment

From this instruction, you will learn how to create an Azure OpenAI model GPT-3.5-turbo/GPT-4.

## Steps

1. [Create a model deployment](#step-1-create-a-model-deployment)
2. [Add model to AI DIAL](#step-2-add-model-to-ai-dial)

## Prerequisites

* Active Azure account
  
## Step 1: Create a model deployment

1. Login to the MS Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) with your credentials. Create an account if you do not have one.
2. Use the search bar to look up **Azure OpenAI** and click it to navigate to the **Azure AI Services|Azure OpenAI** page.

4. You may need to request access to Azure OpenAI Services. Follow the link in the notification to do that. You can review this form by following [this link](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUNTZBNzRKNlVQSFhZMU9aV09EVzYxWFdORCQlQCN0PWcu).

    > It is important to note that certain models may not be accessible for deployment in a particular region. If you need a particular model, you will have to submit a separate request or relocate Azure OpenAI to a different region.

7. Go back to your model page and click **Keys and Endpoint**. In this section, you can find your key and endpoint that you will need to provide in AI DIAL configuration file.

8. You can restrict access to your accounts based on a specific subset of networks by configuring network rules, only applications that access data through the designated set of networks are permitted to access the account. You can manage default network access rules for Azure AI services resources in **Resource Management/Networking**.

## Step 2: Add model to AI DIAL

To deploy a model to AI DIAL, it is necessary to add it to config and configure an adapter for it.

Add you model with its parameters in the `models` section. Refer to [AI DIAL Configuration](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/8a2d6ebe301965ef0e4f06bc5f6e47aadc7b597f/charts/dial/examples/generic/simple/values.yaml#L11) to view an example.

Refer to [Configuration](./configuration.md#core-parameters) to view the description of parameters.

To work with models, we use applications called Adapters. You can configure Adapters in the [AI DIAL Config](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/8a2d6ebe301965ef0e4f06bc5f6e47aadc7b597f/charts/dial/examples/generic/simple/values.yaml#L114).

Refer to [Adapter for OpenAI](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-adapter-openai) to view documentation for a OpenAI AI DIAL Adapter.
