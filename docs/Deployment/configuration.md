# Configuration

> Refer to [AI DIAL Generic Installation Simple Guide](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/tree/main/charts/dial/examples/generic/simple), to view a basic AI DIAL Helm installation guide.

The configuration of AI DIAL includes several main sections:

* [Core](#core-parameters)
* [Chat](#chat-parameters)
* [Chat Themes](#themes-parameters)
* [Adapters](#adapters-parameters)
* [Assistant](#assistant-parameters)
* [Auth Helper](#auth-helper-parameters)

> **Important**: it is assumed that you have a working knowledge of standard Helm chart parameters in order to define them within the configuration file.

## Core Parameters

> Refer to the [AI DIAL Core](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core) to view a complete documentation.

Configure AI DIAL Core parameters in the [`core`](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/8a2d6ebe301965ef0e4f06bc5f6e47aadc7b597f/charts/dial/examples/generic/simple/values.yaml#L1) section of the config file.

You can provide **dynamic** and **static** settings for the AI DIAL Core:

* Static settings are used on startup and cannot be changed while application is running. Refer to [Static settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core#static-settings) to learn more.
* Dynamic settings are stored in JSON files, specified via [config.files](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/8a2d6ebe301965ef0e4f06bc5f6e47aadc7b597f/charts/dial/examples/generic/simple/values.yaml#L6C3-L6C6) static setting, and reloaded at interval, specified via `config.reload` static setting. Refer to [Dynamic settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core#dynamic-settings) to learn more.

> Refer to [Example](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial/blob/main/docs/dial-docker-compose/model/core/config.json#L11) to view an example of a JSON configuration file.

### Some of the dynamic parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|routes|Path(s)  Paths to route to specific upstreams or to respond with configured body.|
|route-rate|Parameters for vote endpoint.|
|applications|A list of deployed AI DIAL Applications and their parameters:<br />`endpoint`: AI DIAL Application API for chat completions.<br />`iconUrl`: a path to the icon used for the AI DIAL Application on the UI.<br />`description`: a brief description of the AI DIAL Application rendered on the UI.<br />`displayName`: a name of the AI DIAL Application used on the UI.|
|models|A list of deployed models and their parameters:<br />`type`: specify `chat` or `embedding` model type.<br />`iconUrl`: a path to the icon used for the model on the UI.<br />`description`: a brief description of the model rendered on the UI.<br />`displayName`: a name of the model rendered on the UI.<br />`endpoint`: model API for chat completions or embeddings.<br />`upstreams`: upstreams are used for load-balancing. A request will be sent to the configured model endpoint and will contain X-UPSTREAM-ENDPOINT and X-UPSTREAM-KEY headers:<br />`endpoint`: model endpoint.<br />`key`: your API key.|
|keys|API Keys parameters:<br />`<proxyKey>`: your API key.<br />`project`: a project name this key is assigned to.<br />`role`: name of one of the configured roles. Defines permissions for the key.<br />`userAuth`: can be disabled/enabled/optional.<br />**Disabled** - Authorization header is ignored and not sent to upstream.<br />**Enabled** - Authorization header is required and sent to upstream. Optional - Authorization header is optional and sent to upstream if present.|
|roles|A list of configured roles with their limitations. Specify a role name and in limits, specify models (can be models, Applications, Addons, Assistants) and limitation configurations:<br />`minute`: the total tokens per minute limit that can be sent to the model is managed using a floating window approach. This technique ensures a well-distributed rate-limiting mechanism, allowing control over the number of tokens sent to the model within a defined time frame, typically a one-minute window.<br />`day`: the total tokens per day limit that can be sent to the model is managed using a floating window approach. This method ensures a balanced rate-limiting mechanism, allowing control over the number of tokens sent to the model within a specified time frame, typically a 24-hour window.<br />Refer to [Roles Management](/docs/tutorials/roles-management.md) to learn more.|

## Chat Parameters

> Refer to the [AI DIAL Chat](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-chat) to view a complete documentation.

Configure Chat parameters in the [`chat`](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/8a2d6ebe301965ef0e4f06bc5f6e47aadc7b597f/charts/dial/examples/generic/simple/values.yaml#L63) section of the config file.

## Themes Parameters

Configure Themes parameters in the [`themes`](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/8a2d6ebe301965ef0e4f06bc5f6e47aadc7b597f/charts/dial/examples/generic/simple/values.yaml#L98) section of the config file.

## Adapters Parameters

To work with Azure, AWS or GCP models we use applications called Adapters. You can configure Adapters in the [AI DIAL Config](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/8a2d6ebe301965ef0e4f06bc5f6e47aadc7b597f/charts/dial/examples/generic/simple/values.yaml#L114).
