# Roles and Access Control for Chat Users

You can use roles to manage access of chat users to system resources.

1. For chat users, you can define user groups/roles/pools (it depends on a specific IDP) in your identity service provider (IDP) which are then passed to AI DIAL in JWT. Refer to [Auth](/Auth/Web/overview) to view supported IDPs and learn how to configure them.
2. You can then utilize user roles from the JWT claims to define roles in the AI DIAL configuration as a `userRoles` parameter value. In the following example, we grant access to `myApplication` for users in the group `operator`. Using the same pattern, you can define roles for models, addons, assistants.

    ```Json
    "applications": {
        "myApplication": {
            "userRoles": [
                "operator"
                ]
            }
    }
    ```

3. In the `roles` section of the configuration file, you can define roles and configure limits for specific system resources. **Important**: you must always use roles from the JWT claims that you receive from your IDP. **Effective role rule**: If a user has a role A and B from the IDP which are not mentioned in the `roles` section, limits from the `default` role apply. If the `default` role has not limits - the access is unlimited. If the `default` role is not defined - the access is unlimited.

    ```json
    "roles": {
        "azure-group-name": {
            "limits": {
                "chat-gpt-35-turbo": {
                    "minute": "200000",
                    "day": "10000000"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
