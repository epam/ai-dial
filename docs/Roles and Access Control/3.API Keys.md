# Roles and Access Control for API Keys

API keys can be used not only for [authentication](/Auth/programmatic-auth), but also to manage access to system resources and apply restrictions on such access.

This is done via assigning of **roles** to API keys. Roles must be associated with specific system resources such as models, applications, addons and assistants.

1. [Create API Key](/Auth/programmatic-auth#step-1-define-api-keys)
2. [Assign role(s)](/Auth/programmatic-auth#step-2-assign-roles) 
3. Add restrictions: 

Roles used by API keys must be declared in the `roles` section. In the following example, we assign the `basic` role for `projectKey1` API key. It grants access to the `chat-gpt-35-turbo` model with some restrictions:

```Json
//Example extract from aidial.config.json
"keys": {
    "proxyKey1": {
        "project": "Project1",
        "role": "basic"
    }
},
"roles": {
    "default": { //role name
        "limits": {
            "chat-gpt-35-turbo": {}
        }
    },
    "basic": { //role name
        "limits": {
            "chat-gpt-35-turbo": {
               "minute": "100000", 
                "day": "10000000" 
            }
        }
    }
}
```
