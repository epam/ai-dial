# Roles and Access Control for API Keys

API keys can be used not only for [authentication](/Auth/programmatic-auth), but also to manage access to system resources and apply restrictions on such access.

This is done via assigning of **roles** to API keys. Roles must be associated with specific system resources such as models, applications, addons and assistants.

To create and configure access control for API keys:

1. [Create API Key](/Auth/programmatic-auth#step-1-define-api-keys)
2. [Assign role(s)](/Auth/programmatic-auth#step-2-assign-roles) 
3. Add restrictions: 

    Roles used by API keys must be declared in the `roles` section. In the following example, we assign the `basic` role for `projectKey1` API key. It grants access to the `chat-gpt-35-turbo` model with some restrictions:

    ```Json
    //Example extract from aidial.config.json
    "keys": {
        "proxyKey1": { //API key
            "project": "Project1",
            "role": "basic" // the name of the role
        }
    },
    "roles": {
        "basic": { // the name of the role
            "limits": {
                "chat-gpt-35-turbo": {
                "minute": "100000", //number of tokens per minute
                "day": "10000000" //number of tokens per day
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    > In [settings](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core?tab=readme-ov-file#dynamic-settings), you can get familiar with the description of the configuration parameters. Refer to [configuration file](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core/blob/development/sample/aidial.config.json) to view the full example.
