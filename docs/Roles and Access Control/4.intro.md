# Using Roles for Access Control

## Overview

Roles in AI DIAL are a powerful way to manage access and functionality within the system.

**Resource Access Control:** Roles determine who can use specific resources like AI models or applications. For instance, you can grant "operator" users access to the "chat-gpt-35-turbo" model.

**Usage Limits:** Roles can enforce limits on resource usage, preventing overuse and abuse. You can set daily, weekly, or monthly token limits for specific roles using a model.

**Custom Application Logic:** Developers can leverage roles within their applications to create custom behaviors. By accessing role information from user tokens, applications can tailor responses or restrict access to internal assets.

**System Feature Access:** Roles manage access to system-level features, ensuring only authorized users have access. For example, only users with the "admin" role might be able to access the administration console.

In essence, roles in AI DIAL provide a flexible and granular mechanism for managing access, controlling resource utilization, and customizing application behavior. 

## API Keys

API keys in AI DIAL are not just for [authentication](#). API keys in AI DIAL, combined with roles and configuration settings, provide a robust mechanism for managing how external applications and services interact with your AI resources, ensuring security and controlled usage. 

Here's how it works:

**Role-Based Access:** API keys are assigned specific roles, which dictate the resources they can access. These roles are linked to system resources like AI models, applications, and add-ons.

**Defining Access and Restrictions:** You create an API key and assign it a role (e.g., "user"). In the [system configuration](#), you define the permissions and limitations associated with that role. For example, the "user" role might grant access to the "chat-gpt-35-turbo" model but with specific usage limits (tokens per minute, day, etc.).

> Refer to [Tutorials](#) to learn how to configure roles and limits.

**Configuration and Control:** The `aidial.config.json` file is where you define API keys, their roles, and the associated access controls. This centralized configuration allows for granular management of API access and resource utilization.

> Refer to [DIAL Core](#) to view configuration examples.

## JWT

AI DIAL allows you to control how chat users access system resources like models, applications, conversations, prompts and files. This is achieved by integrating with your existing identity service provider (IDP) and using roles for granular access management. 

**IDP Integration:** AI DIAL connects with your IDP (e.g., Azure Active Directory) to manage users and groups. You define user roles and groups within your IDP, which are then passed to AI DIAL through JWT (JSON Web Token). Refer to [Tutorials](#) to learn what IDPs are supported and how to configure this integration.

**Role-Based Access Control:** In the AI DIAL configuration, you specify which user roles from your IDP have access to specific resources. For example, you can grant the "operator" role access to the "chat-gpt-35-turbo" model. Refer to [Tutorials](#) to learn how to configure roles.

**Usage Limits by Role:** You can define usage limits for each role to prevent resource overuse. This could involve setting limits on tokens per minute, day, or month for a specific model. Refer to [Tutorials](#) to learn how to configure limits for roles.

**Default Role and Unrestricted Access:** If a user's IDP roles aren't explicitly mentioned in the AI DIAL configuration, a "default" role is applied. If the "default" role is not defined or has no limits set, access to the resource is unrestricted.
