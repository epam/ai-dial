# Overview

In AI DIAL, you can use **roles** for various purposes:

* Grant access to system resources
* Restrict access to system resources
* Implement a custom logic in applications
* Give access to specific system features

## Access to Resources

You can use roles to grant access for chat users and applications to listings - deployed system resources such as applications, models, assistants and addons. 

In the following example, we grant access to `myApplication` for users in the group `operator`:

```Json
"applications": {
    "myApplication": {
        "userRoles": [
            "operator"
            ]
        }
}
```

> Refer to [configuration example](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-core/blob/development/sample/aidial.config.json) to view the full example.

## Access Restriction

You can impose `limits` on the number of requests to a specific resource for roles. For instance, you could set a restriction on the number of tokens that can be sent to a model.

In the following example, limits applied for the `operator` role to work with `chat-gpt-35-turbo` model and there are no limits for `default` role to work with the same model:

```Json
//Example extract from aidial.config.json

"roles": {
    "operator": { //role name
        "limits": {
            "chat-gpt-35-turbo": { //model name
                "minute": "100000", //overrides the default value
                "day": "10000000"
            }
        }
    },
    "default": {
        "limits": {
            "chat-gpt-35-turbo": {} // the default value applies - unlimited
        }
    },
}
```

## Custom Logic Development 

Application is any custom logic with a conversation interface packaged as a ready-to-use solution. It can be any component conforming with the AI DIAL Unified Protocol requirements. You can use the [AI DIAL SDK](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-sdk) to develop such applications.

In your applications, you can implement any custom logic around roles using `forwardAuthToken`, which takes as a value the claim from JWT. For example, define the way a model responses based on a role or restrict access to specific assets or datasets. 

## Access to Features

You can use roles to manage access to specific system features, such as administration console in the chat application where administrators can review and approve publication requests. Only users in the admin group can access this functionality.
